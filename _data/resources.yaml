  - title: adv3Lite
    description: adv3Lite is a TADS 3 library based off Adv3, written and maintained by Eric Eve. It aims to provide a library that's easier to use than the Adv3 library, but which is almost as powerful and expressive. Adv3Lite misses out the bits that most games don't really need (like postures, room parts, and multiple light levels) while adding in some other bits that are often more useful (like scenes and regions, "borrowed" from Inform 7). Adv3Lite also cuts down drastically on the complexity of the Adv3 class hierarchy while maintaining much of their functionality.
