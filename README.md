# TADS 3 Cookbook
Tasty TADS 3 recipes for solving common and uncommon problems.

There are two aspects to the TADS 3 Cookbook:

* A [wiki](https://github.com/jimbonator/tads-cookbook/wiki) of recipes, one problem and solution per page
* A [repository](https://github.com/jimbonator/tads-cookbook) of code with examples that may be compiled, executed, and experimented with

The wiki and code samples are intended to be brief, and not a full-fledged tutorial of the TADS language or library.
