# TADS 3 Cookbook
Tasty TADS 3 recipes for solving common and uncommon problems when writing interactive fiction.

There are two aspects of the TADS 3 Cookbook:

* A [wiki](https://github.com/jimbonator/tads-cookbook/wiki) of recipes, with one problem and solution per page
* A [repository](https://github.com/jimbonator/tads-cookbook) of code examples that may be compiled, played, and experimented with

The wiki and code samples are intended to be brief, and not full-fledged tutorials of the TADS language or library.
