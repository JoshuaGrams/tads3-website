# Procedural Code

TADS 3 lets you do a lot "declaratively," meaning that you just define
objects, their attributes, and their relationships to one another, and
the system and library take care of the details of running the game.
That's great as far as it goes, but no one has ever developed a system
that can do *everything* declaratively (though some have tried). For the
things you can't do declaratively, TADS 3 provides a powerful
"procedural" language, which lets you write step-by-step instructions
for the computer to follow.

## <span id="functionsAndMethods">Functions and methods</span>

There are two places where procedural code can appear. The first is in
"functions," and the second is in "methods."

A function is a body of procedural instructions that's all grouped up
and given a name. Functions are so named because they resemble in form
what mathematicians call functions: a function takes a set of input
values, which we call parameters, and produces an output value as its
result. For example, in mathematics, the "square root" function takes a
number as its argument, and yields the square root of the number as its
result. Now, in mathematics, there are other requirements that must be
met before you can truly call something a function, but for our purposes
a function is this just basic "black box" that takes a set of inputs and
produces a result value.

A method is almost the same as a function, but has the additional
quality that it's associated with a particular object or class. This
grouping of procedural code as part of an object is a defining feature
of Object-Oriented Programming. It's proved to be a very useful
organizational tool, because it encourages programmers to think about
how a problem breaks down into data structures, and then provides a way
to group each data structure with the parts of the code that operate on
it.

### <span id="funcdef">Defining a function</span>

A function definition has this form:

<div class="syntax">

    functionName ( [ paramName [ , paramName ... ]  ]  )
    {
       functionBody
    }

</div>

Note that the parentheses for the parameter list are always required. If
you want to define a function that doesn't take any parameters, just use
empty parentheses after the function name.

The parameter names act like local variables defined just inside the
function body's open-brace. This means that you can't define a local
variable with the same name in the function's outermost code block.
(It's legal to reuse a parameter's name for a local within a nested
block, though, for the same reason you can define a new local in a
nested block with the same name as a local in an outer block.)

The function body consists of a series of procedural statements. When
the function is invoked, the VM starts at the first (topmost) procedural
statement in the function body, and proceeds through them sequentially
until the function returns to its caller via an explicit
<span class="code">return</span> statement, throws an error, or "falls
off the end" (that is, the sequential execution point reaches the
function body's closing brace). Falling off the end is equivalent to
returning <span class="code">nil</span>, so it's as though there were a
<span class="code">return nil;</span> statement just before the function
body's closing brace.

A function definition can only appear in "top-level" code - that is,
outside of any object, class, or function definition. If you use this
syntax within an object or class definition, the compiler will think you
want to define a method.

Function names are global. A symbol that's used as the name of a
function cannot be used to name anything else with global scope (such as
properties, objects, classes, enums).

To call a function, you write the function name followed by its
arguments, enclosed in parentheses. This syntax constitutes a
*function-call expression*, and you can use it anywhere an expression
can go, including within a larger expression.

For example, here's a complete program that defines two functions:
<span class="code">main()</span>, which is the main entrypoint function
that every program must provide, and <span class="code">cube()</span>,
which raises a given number to the third power and returns the result.
The <span class="code">main()</span> function uses
<span class="code">cube()</span> to calculate a few cubed values,
displays them, and exits.

<div class="code">

    #include "tads.h"

    main(args)
    {
      local c1 = cube(1), c2 = cube(2), c3 = cube(3);
      local cc3 = cube(c3);

      "1 cubed = &lt;<c1>&gt;, 2 cubed = &lt;<c2>&gt;, 3 cubed = &lt;<c3>&gt;\n";
      "3 cubed cubed &lt;<cc3>&gt;\n";
    }

    cube(n)
    {
      return n * n * n;
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

### <span id="optArgs">Optional arguments</span>

In some cases, it's convenient to be able to declare a function or
method parameter as optional. This means that a caller can provide an
argument value for the parameter, but doesn't have to: a caller can
simply omit the argument entirely if it wants to use the default value
for the parameter.

The syntax for optional parameters is simple. Just place a
"<span class="code">?</span>" after the name of a parameter:

<div class="code">

    stringToInt(str, radix?)
    {
      // ...
    }

</div>

This lets callers call the function with or without the "radix"
parameter:

<div class="code">

    x = stringToInt('12345');
    y = stringToInt('3F7A', 16);

</div>

When only one argument is supplied, it's assigned to "str", because that
parameter is required, and the optional "radix" parameter is set to the
default value <span class="code">nil</span>. When two arguments are
supplied, the first is assigned to "str" and the second to "radix".

For this particular example, it would be even better to be able to
define a specific default value for the "radix" argument. Fortunately,
there's syntax for this: rather than using the
"<span class="code">?</span>" suffix, instead write
"<span class="code">=</span> *expression*", where *expression* gives the
default value to be applied:

<div class="code">

    stringToInt(str, radix = 10)
    {
      // ...
    }

</div>

This says that the "radix" parameter should be set to 10 whenever a
caller doesn't supply a second argument value. When the caller *does*
provide two arguments, the caller's value overrides the default value.

For more information, including a couple of subtleties that are worth
knowing about, see the [optional parameters section](optparams.html).

### <span id="namedArgs">Named arguments</span>

The usual way of passing arguments, as described above, is
**positional**: the first value listed in the caller's argument list is
assigned to the first variable name in the callee's parameter list, the
caller's second value goes to the callee's second parameter name, and so
on.

There's another way, which we call **named arguments**. Instead of
assigning values to parameter names by position, the caller actually
specifies the name to use for each value. The values are then assigned
to variables with the same names in the callee, regardless of the order
of the values.

The caller and callee **both** have to agree on this protocol. When
defining a function, you specify that it takes named argument values by
putting a colon after each parameter name:

<div class="code">

    diff(a:, b:)
    {
       return a - b;
    }

</div>

The caller invokes this function with similar syntax: for each named
parameter, we must write the name, a colon, and then the value to use
for that parameter:

<div class="code">

    local x = diff(a: 5, b: 3);

</div>

Because the parameters are named, the caller can list them in a
different order from the callee. So we can rewrite the call above as
follows, and we'll get exactly the same result:

<div class="code">

    local x = diff(b: 3, a: 5);

</div>

You can freely mix positional and named parameters in the same function
definition. Parameters with the colon suffix will be named, and those
without will be positional. The caller must specify the positional
parameters in the same order as in the function definition, but the
named parameters can be mixed into the list in any order.

For full details on named parameters and why (and when) you'd want to
use them, see the [named arguments chapter](namedargs.html).

### <span id="funcModRep">Replacing or modifying a function</span>

When using a library, it's sometimes useful to be able to replace a
function that the library provides with your own definition. The
<span class="code">replace</span> keyword lets you do this. To use this
feature, just write <span class="code">replace</span> in front of your
function definition:

<div class="code">

    replace someFunc(a, b)
    {
       // new code for the function...
    }

</div>

<span class="code">replace</span> completely discards the original
library definition of the function, and replaces it with your new
definition; it's as though the library version were never defined.

Sometimes you want to augment a library function rather than replace it
entirely. For example, you might want to add some special-case handling
for one or two particular parameter values, but fall back on the
original library definition for everything else. In these cases, you can
"modify" a function. This replaces the original function with your new
version, but it also keeps the original function around; the old
function loses the right to use the name, but its code is still present.
Whenever any code calls the function by name, your new version will be
invoked.

To reach the original version of the function, you use a special
keyword, <span class="code">replaced</span>, within your new version of
the function. This is the only place where
<span class="code">replaced</span> works - you can only reach the old
function from within your new version.
<span class="code">replaced</span> looks syntactically like a function
call: you write, for example, <span class="code">replaced(7, 'a')</span>
to invoke the original function.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    getName(val)
    {
      switch(dataType(val))
      {
      case TypeObject:
        return val.name;

      default:
        return 'unknown';
      }
    }

    modify getName(val)
    {
      if (dataType(val) == TypeSString)
        return '\'' + val + '\'';
      else
        return replaced(val);
    }

</div>

Note how the modified function refers back to the original version: we
add handling for string values, which the original definition didn't
provide, but simply invoke the original version of the function for any
other type. The call to <span class="code">replaced(val)</span> invokes
the previous definition of the function, which we're replacing.

Once a function is redefined using modify, it's no longer possible to
invoke the old definition of the function directly by name. The only way
to reach the old definition is via the
<span class="code">replaced</span> keyword, and that can only be used
within the new definition of the function. However, note that you can
obtain a pointer to the old function, and then invoke the old function
through that pointer outside the bounds of the redefinition. To get the
pointer, use the <span class="code">replaced</span> keyword without an
argument list.

### <span id="methdef">Defining a method</span>

A method definition looks just like a function definition syntactically.
The only difference is the placement within the source code. Whereas a
function is declared at the top level of the program, outside of all
objects, a method is declared within an object. For example:

<div class="code">

    class MyClass: object
      getOwner()
      {
        // code goes here...
      }
    ;

</div>

In most respects, a method acts very much like a function. The
difference is that a method is associated with the class or object in
which it's defined. The method can only be invoked through the defining
object or class, or it can be reached by "inheritance" - that is,
through a descendant in the class hierarchy (that is, a subclass of this
object or class, a subclass of a subclass, etc., or an instance of the
class). To call a method, then, you have to name not only the method
itself but also the object it's associated with. You do that with the
"dot" operator (<span class="code">.</span>), like this:

<div class="code">

    local x = MyClass.getOwner();

</div>

Within the method, you can use the <span class="code">self</span>
pseudo-variable to determine which object was used to invoke the method.
Now, it might seem that this information is redundant, since the method
is by its very nature already associated with a particular object or
class. But as we just mentioned, you can reach the method through the
defining object/class *or* through a subclass or instance of the
defining object. For example, consider this code:

<div class="code">

    local x = new MyClass();
    local y = x.getOwner();

</div>

This creates an instance of the class, then calls the method on the
instance object, not on the class itself. If you looked at
<span class="code">self</span> within the method in this case, it would
contain the instance object, not MyClass itself.

One of the key principles behind object-oriented programming is that
code related to an object should be grouped with the object, by defining
the code using methods. So one thing you tend to see a lot of in
well-designed OO code is one method of an object calling another method
of the same object. In other words, you tend to see a lot of
<span class="code">self.xxx()</span> calls within method code. This is
so common that TADS 3 has a convenient short-hand notation for just this
case: when calling a method or property of
<span class="code">self</span> within a method, you can omit the
<span class="code">self.</span> prefix entirely, and just write the
method call as though it were a function call. For example:

<div class="code">

    class MyClass
      isOwned()
      {
        // check some conditions, and return true or nil...
      }
      getOwner()
      {
        if (isOwned())
          // do something...
      }
    ;

</div>

In this example, the call to <span class="code">isOwned()</span> within
<span class="code">getOwner()</span> is *not* a function call, even
though it looks like one at first glance. Rather, it's a method call,
and behaves exactly as though we'd written
<span class="code">self.isOwned()</span>.

### <span id="shortMeth">Short-hand method definitions</span>

In addition to the standard function-like syntax for defining a method,
there are a couple of short-hand formats that are more convenient for
simple methods.

First, if a method take no parameters, you can omit the parameter list.
This is especially handy for one-liner methods, where the whole body of
the method fits on one line:

<div class="code">

    class MyClass
      getOwner { // etc }
    ;

</div>

Second, if a method takes no parameters, and the only thing it does is
evaluate an expression and return the result, you can write the method
almost as though it were a property definition, like this:

<div class="code">

    class MyClass
      getOwner = (myOwner != nil ? myOwner.actualOwner(self) : nil)

</div>

That has exactly the same meaning as if
<span class="code">getOwner()</span> had been defined like this:

<div class="code">

      getOwner()
      {
        return myOwner != nil ? myOwner.actualOwner(self) : nil;
      }

</div>

These short-hand formats are syntactic variations only - they don't make
any difference in the behavior, size, or speed of the generated code.
The short-hand syntax might make your *source* code look smaller, but it
won't make your *compiled* code any smaller or any faster, because the
compiler generates the same byte-code in any case. These syntax
variations are for your coding convenience; they're not performance
optimizations.

### <span id="floatingMethods">Floating methods</span>

Another way of defining a method is to define it *without* an associated
object definition. This is called a "floating" method, since it's not
attached to any object definition.

The syntax for a floating method is almost the same as for a function.
The only difference is that you substitute the keyword
<span class="code">method</span> for <span class="code">function</span>:

<div class="code">

    method getTopLoc()
    {
       return location == nil ? self : location;
    }

</div>

Even though this looks like a function, you can use
<span class="code">self</span>, and access properties of
<span class="code">self</span> (such as
<span class="code">location</span>, in this example). You can also
access all of the other method context pseudo-variables
(<span class="code">definingobj</span>,
<span class="code">targetobj</span>, and
<span class="code">targetprop</span>), and you can use
<span class="code">inherited</span> and
<span class="code">delegated</span>. None of these things are allowed in
an ordinary function, since there's no method context in an ordinary
function.

A floating method actually *is* a function. If you look at
<span class="code">dataType(getTopLoc)</span>, you'll see that it's
<span class="code">TypeFuncPtr</span>. You *can* call it like a regular
function, without an object:

<div class="code">

    local t = getTopLoc();

</div>

However, if the method accesses <span class="code">self</span> or other
method context variables, calling it this way will cause a run-time
error. That's what would happen in our example, since it references a
property of <span class="code">self</span>. The problem is that a
function call doesn't have a method context, so references to method
context variables won't work the way they do when a method is running.

So if it's not really callable as a function, and it's not callable as a
method because it's not associated with any object, what exactly is it
good for? The answer, of course, is adoption.

Floating methods are intended to be associated with objects
*eventually*, even though they're not initially. Their purpose is to let
you define a method that's not *initially* attached to any object, but
only so that you can attach it dynamically, at run-time, as an actual
method of one or more objects. You do this using
<span class="code">TadsObject.setMethod()</span>, which you can find
more about [here](tadsobj.html#setMethod).

### <span id="varargs">Varying argument lists</span>

A function or method can be defined as taking a varying number of
parameters. That is, rather than specifying an exact number of arguments
that the caller must supply, you can define the function or method so
that it lets the *caller* decide how many arguments to supply; the
function or method determines how many were actually passed at run-time.
(This is sometimes called a "varargs" function, for "varying
arguments.") To define this type of function or method, you use an
ellipsis, <span class="code">...</span>, in place of the last parameter
name. For example:

<div class="code">

    printf(fmt, ...) { }
    {
      // code goes here...
    }

</div>

When you define a function/method that takes varying parameters, callers
must supply *at least* the named parameters, and may then supply any
number (including zero) of additional arguments. The first argument
value (starting at the left) that the caller supplies is assigned to the
first named parameter in the function's or methods' parameter list, the
second argument value is assigned to the second named parameter, and so
on. You can retrieve the unnamed extra parameters using the
<span class="code">getArg()</span> intrinsic function, and you can
determine the total number of arguments using the
<span class="code">argcount</span> pseudo-variable.
<span class="code">getArg(n)</span> returns the *n*th argument value,
where *n* ranges from 1 to <span class="code">argcount</span>.

It's equally valid to use an ellipsis as the *entire* parameter list, if
you want to accept zero or more arguments:

<div class="code">

    printStuff(...)
    {
      // code goes here...
    }

</div>

Since there are no named arguments, the caller doesn't have to supply
any arguments at all, and you must access all of the arguments via
<span class="code">getArg()</span>.

You can alternatively give the varying part of the parameter list a
name, indicating to the compiler that you want the extra arguments to be
bundled up into a list and made accessible as a local variable. To do
this, replace the ellispis (<span class="code">...</span>) with a
parameter name, but enclose the parameter name in square brackets:

<div class="code">

    printf(fmt, [lst])
    {
       foreach (local x in lst)
         // do something...
    }

</div>

This is exactly like the earlier <span class="code">printf(fmt,
...)</span> declaration, but it creates a list from the extra parameters
and stores it in the local variable <span class="code">lst</span>.

The "varying list" syntax is essentially equivalent functionally to the
ellipsis syntax, but many people find it cleaner-looking and easier to
use, since it lets you operate on the varying arguments using the
language's standard list features. However, note that it's slightly less
efficient, because the VM has to go to a little extra trouble to create
the list for you. For most functions and methods, the cleaner and easier
coding is well worth the slight performance cost; but for a
performance-critical function (one that's called very frequently, for
example), you might get better execution speed with the ellipsis style.

### <span id="varargsCall">Varying-argument calls</span>

In addition to being able to *receive* varying arguments as a list, you
can *send* a list value to a function or method, as though the list were
a series of individual argument values. To do this, place an ellipsis
after the list argument value in the function or method call's argument
list:

<div class="code">

    local lst = [1, 2, 3];
    formatStr('x[%d, %d] = %d', lst...);

</div>

Rather than passing two arguments to
<span class="code">formatStr()</span> (i.e., a string and a four-element
list), this passes four arguments (a string, the integer 1, the integer
2, and the integer 3), as though all four had been passed as separate
arguments - in other words, the call is identical to this:

<div class="code">

    formatStr('x[%d, %d] = %d', 1, 2, 3);

</div>

This notation allows you to call a function that takes a variable
argument list, using a list to provide the varying argument values. This
makes it possible to layer calls to functions and methods with variable
argument lists, since an intermediate function can itself take a
variable argument list and later pass the same arguments to another
variable argument function.

## <span id="externDecl">External declarations</span>

When you build your program, the compiler scans all of the source files
in your project for symbol names before it does anything else. This
means that you can define a function or an object in one source file,
and freely refer to it from another source file; and similarly, you can
freely refer to functions and objects that are not defined until later
in the same source file. The compiler's pre-scan of the entire source
ensures that it knows how symbols are used throughout the program. This
eliminates most of the "external" and "forward" declaration overhead
that many other programming languages force you to use.

In a few rare cases, though, you might actually need to explicitly
define external symbols. This happens only when you're compiling part of
a program in isolation, and won't combine the compiled object files with
the rest of the program until later. The most likely situation where
this would happen is in creating a library, where you want to distribute
the library in compiled form rather than as source files.

To define a function or object as external, you use the
<span class="code">extern</span> statement. This statement can be used
to define functions, objects, and classes. The syntax is:

<div class="syntax">

    extern function functionName ( [ param [ , param ... ]  ]  ) ;
    extern object objectName ;
    extern class className ;

</div>

These statements must be placed in "top level" code, outside of all
object or function definitions.

## <span id="propdecl">Property name declarations</span>

For the most part, the compiler automatically determines the type of
each symbol used throughout the program - object name, function name,
class name, property name, enum, etc. The compiler recognizes a symbol
as a property name when the symbol is used to define a property or
method of an object:

<div class="code">

    class MyClass: object
       name = 'my class'
       weight = 10
       getOwner() { return owner; }
    ;

</div>

The compiler will automatically infer from this code that
<span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">weight</span>, and
<span class="code">getOwner()</span> are property names, since they're
used to explicitly define properties and methods of MyClass.

In some cases, you won't have occasion to define a value for a
particular property as part of an object definition anywhere in the
program, but you still want to use the name as a property name. For
these situations, the compiler lets you explicitly declare a symbol as
being a property name. The syntax is:

<div class="syntax">

    property propName [ , propName ... ]  ;

</div>

This statement declares each listed symbol as a property. It must be
placed in "top level" code, outside of all object or function
definitions.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    property name, weight, getOwner;

</div>

Note that you can define method names as well as property names. A
method name is identical to a property name in terms of the symbol type,
so there's no difference in the declaration syntax.

## <span id="statements">Procedural statements</span>

Within a function or method body, you can write a series of procedural
steps, called "statements." A procedural statement is a single program
instruction.

Every statement starts with a "keyword" that indicates what action
should be carried out when the statement is executed. Actually, make
that *almost* every statement; there are a couple of exceptions. An
"expression" statement simply consists of an expression to evaluate,
with no introductory keyword. Also, there's such a thing as an "empty"
statement, which contains nothing at all except for the final semicolon
that all statements require. (An empty statement does nothing at all -
which sounds useless, but it actually is useful in some cases as a
placeholder, to fill in a spot that syntactically requires a statement
but for which you have no actual work to do.)

Most statements have some extra information after the keyword, giving
the specifics about what to do in the course of carrying out the
statement.

All statements end with a semicolon (<span class="code">;</span>).

The interpreter carries out a function or method by executing its
statements, one at a time, starting at the first. In the simplest case,
execution steps sequentially through the statements in the function
until reaching the last one. Usually, though, it's not quite this
simple, because some statements "jump" to another point in the function.
The <span class="code">if</span> statement, for example, jumps to one
point if a given condition is true, and a different point if the
condition is false. The <span class="code">for</span> statement sets up
a loop, where a group of statements is repeatedly executed as long as a
condition is true.

### <span id="blocks">Code blocks</span>

A "code block" is a group of statements enclosed in braces
(<span class="code">{ }</span>). Code blocks are important for two
reasons:

First, grouping statements with braces turns the group into what's
effectively a single statement. In almost any place where a single
statement is required, you can substitute a code block for the single
statement. This is how you write a <span class="code">for</span> loop
with several statements in the loop body, for example.

A group of statements enclosed in braces acts syntactically like a
complete statement - *including* the obligatory semicolon that ends
every statement. That means that when you use a brace group in a slot
designed for a single statement, you **must not** add a semicolon after
the closing brace. For example:

<div class="code">

    // WRONG!!!  The extra semicolon is redundant
    if (x == 1)
      { someFunc(1); };

    // Right
    if (x == 1)
      { someFunc(1); }

</div>

Second, code blocks define the "scope" of local variables. A local
variable defined within a given code block exists only within that
block - that is, only as far as the next closing brace, not counting the
closing braces of nested code blocks.

<div class="code">

    myFunc(x)
    {
      local a;

      if (x == 1)
      {
        local b;

        // local a is still valid here, since we're only nested -
        // symbols in scope within a given code block are in scope
        // within any blocks nested within
      }
      // local b is now out of scope, since we've ended the code
      // block where it was defined

      // local a is still in scope, of course, since we're still in
      // its code block
    }
    // now local a is out of scope, too, since we've ended its block

</div>

### <span id="labels">Statement labels</span>

A statement can be given a "label." This is a symbol that you can use to
refer to the labeled statement, such as in
<span class="code">goto</span> or <span class="code">break</span>
statements.

Statement labels have function/method scope. That is, a label is visible
within the *entire* function or method in which it's defined, but is not
visible outside the function or method. Even if a label is defined
within a nested code block, it's still visible throughout the entire
function.

You label a statement by writing the label, followed by a colon,
followed by the statement itself. For example, this function contains an
<span class="code">if</span> statement labeled
"<span class="code">stm1</span>":

<div class="code">

    myFunc(x)
    {
    stm1:
      if (x &gt; 1)
      {
        --x;
        goto stm1;
      }
    }

</div>

A statement label **must** be followed by a statement. While this might
seem obvious, there's a common situation where you might accidentally
write a label without a statement:

<div class="code">

    myFunc(x)
    {
      if (x == 1)
      {
        // do some work...

        // check for errors
        if (errorOccurred())
          goto done;

        // do some more work...

      done:  // WRONG!!! there's no statement for this label!
      }
    }

</div>

In this example, what we'd like to do is to jump to the end of the
<span class="code">if</span> block if an error has occurred at a certain
point, to bypass the remaining work we were going to do. The problem is
that we've written our label just before the closing brace of the
<span class="code">if</span> block. A closing brace doesn't constitute a
statement, so it's illegal to put a label here. Fortunately, this is
easily solved: all we have to do is add an empty statement after the
label:

<div class="code">

      done: ;  // this is fine, since we have a statement for the label now

</div>

### <span id="emptystm">Empty statements</span>

The "empty statement" consists of merely a semicolon:

<div class="code">

    ;

</div>

When executed, an empty statement has no effect.

Despite their meaninglessness at run-time, empty statements are useful
in certain situations. One use is to supply the required statement for a
label at the end of a code block. Another is to provide an empty loop
body for a <span class="code">for</span> or other looping statement:

<div class="code">

    for (i = 1 ; i &lt; 10 ; handle(i++)) ;

</div>

In this example, everything the loop needs to do is written within the
<span class="code">for</span> statement itself, so we don't need
anything in the loop body. But the syntax of the
<span class="code">for</span> statement requires us to supply
*something* as the loop body regardless, so we can use an empty
statement to fill the syntactic need without adding any run-time
overhead.

### <span id="local">local</span>

The <span class="code">local</span> statement defines one or more local
variables, and optionally assigns initial values to them.

<div class="syntax">

    local varName [ = expression ]  [ , ... ]  ;

</div>

Local variables are in scope from the <span class="code">local</span>
statement to the end of the enclosing code block. A local is **not** in
scope before the <span class="code">local</span> statement that defines
it ("before" meaning earlier in the source text), and it goes out of
scope at the closing brace of its enclosing code block.

It's legal to define a local variable in a nested code block with the
same name as a variable in the enclosing code block. For example:

<div class="code">

    myFunc(x)
    {
      local a = 7;

      if (x == 1)
      {
        local a = x;
      }

      return a;
    }

</div>

This function as written always returns 7, because the local variable
named <span class="code">a</span> that's definfed within the
<span class="code">if</span> statement's code block is a different
variable from the <span class="code">a</span> defined within the
function's main code block. The two <span class="code">a</span>'s share
the same name, but they're nonetheless distinct variables: so assigning
<span class="code">x</span> to the "inner" <span class="code">a</span>
has no effect on the "outer" <span class="code">a</span>.

When you define a local variable in a nested block with the same name as
a local defined in an enclosing block, the variable in the nested block
"hides" the one in the enclosing block as long as it's in scope. There's
no way to refer to the hidden variable from within the nested block in
this case.

If no initializer is supplied for a variable, the local variable is
initialized to nil at entry to the function or method containing the
<span class="code">local</span> statement. If an initializer is
supplied, the expression is evaluated when the
<span class="code">local</span> statement is executed, and the value is
assigned to the local variable.

Each initializer expression applies to one variable only. For example:

<div class="code">

    local a, b, c = 7;

</div>

This initializes <span class="code">c</span> to 7, and leaves
<span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> with the
default <span class="code">nil</span> value.

<span class="code">local</span> statements that include initializers
count as executable statements. This means that they're executed as
they're encountered, just like any other statement. This is important to
keep in mind when writing a loop:

<div class="code">

    for (i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; ++i)
    {
      local j = 7;

      if (i &lt; j)
        ++j;
    }

</div>

The important thing to note here is that <span class="code">j</span> is
re-initialized to 7 *every time through the loop*.

If a <span class="code">local</span> statement doesn't include an
initializer for a variable, that variable is initialized to
<span class="code">nil</span> at entry to the function or method, but is
**not** reset to <span class="code">nil</span> each time the
<span class="code">local</span> statement is executed. In fact, a
<span class="code">local</span> statement without an initializer doesn't
have any run-time effect, other than to reserve space for the local
variable when the function or method is entered.

### <span id="exprstm">Expression statements</span>

An expression, all by itself, counts as a statement.

<div class="syntax">

    expression ;

</div>

Expression statements are typically the most numerous type of statement
in a program, because they're the main way to call functions and
methods, assign values to variables, invoke intrinsic functions, and so
on.

When you write an expression as a statement, it's virtually always to
invoke the side effects of the expression. It's pointless to write an
expression statement where the expression has no side effects:

<div class="code">

    x + 2;  // a pointless statement!

</div>

That does nothing meaningful: it adds 2 to x, but since the expression
doesn't do anything with the result, the result is simply discarded.

So, typically, an expression statement includes something with side
effects:

- a function call
- a method call
- assigning a value to a variable
- incrementing or decrementing a variable with
  <span class="code">++</span> or <span class="code">--</span>

Here are some examples:

<div class="code">

    myFunc(7);
    x = x + 3;
    myObj.weight *= 2;

</div>

### <span id="dqstm">Double-quoted string statement</span>

A double-quoted string, written by itself as a statement, displays the
string. (More precisely, it calls the default display function, which
the default startup sets to <span class="code">tadsSay()</span>, with
the string's text as the argument.) For example:

<div class="code">

    "Hello, world!\n";

</div>

In addition to displaying fixed text, double-quoted strings can display
embedded variables and expressions. You embed an expression within a
double-quoted string by enclosing the expression within
<span class="code">\&lt;\&lt; \&gt;\&gt;</span> marks within the string:

<div class="code">

    "x = &lt;<x>&gt;, y*5 = &lt;&lt;y*5&gt;&gt;\n";

&lt;/div&gt;

The compiler treats this as though it were a series of statements like
this:

<div class="code">

    {
      "x = ";
      tadsSay(x);
      ", y*5 = ";
      tadsSay(y*5);
      "\n";
    }

</div>

Embedded expressions are evaluated each time they're encountered. The
expressions within a string are evaluated in the order in which they
appear in the string. Expression values are displayed according to their
datatype:

- **string:** the text of the string is displayed
- **integer:** the decimal representation of the number is displayed
- **BigNumber:** the number is displayed using the default formatting
- **nil:** nothing is displayed
- **all other types:** a run-time error ("invalid type") is generated

For more on embedded expressions, see the section on [string
literals](strlit.html#embeddings).

### <span id="return">return</span>

The <span class="code">return</span> statement exits the current
function or method and resumes execution in the caller. Optionally, the
statement can specify an expression to evaluate as the return value of
the function or method.

<div class="syntax">

    return [ expression ]  ;

</div>

If an expression is specified, it's evaluated when the
<span class="code">return</span> statement is executed, and the result
is returned to the caller as the result value of the current function or
method. If no expression is specified, the default return value of
<span class="code">nil</span> is used.

When a <span class="code">return</span> statement is executed, the VM
first executes the <span class="code">finally</span> clause of each
enclosing <span class="code">try</span> statement, working from the
innermost outward. It then exits the function and resumes execution in
the caller.

### <span id="if">if</span>

The <span class="code">if</span> statement executes a statement if a
given condition is true, and can optionally execute a different
statement if the given condition is false.

<div class="syntax">

    if ( conditionExpression )
      thenPart
    [ else
      elsePart ] 

</div>

Each of <span class="synPar">thenPart</span> and
<span class="synPar">elsePart</span> are single statements, or code
blocks enclosed in braces.

The <span class="code">if</span> statement first evaluates the condition
expression. Then:

- If the result is anything except 0 or <span class="code">nil</span>,
  the <span class="synPar">truePart</span> is executed, then execution
  jumps to the next statement after the entire
  <span class="code">if</span>.
- Otherwise:
  - If an <span class="code">else</span> clause is specified, the
    <span class="synPar">elsePart</span> is executed, then execution
    resumes at the next statement.
  - If there's no <span class="code">else</span> clause, execution jumps
    directly to the next statement.

Since TADS uses a C-like syntax, it inherits a sometimes
counterintuitive quirk of C that affects nested
<span class="code">if</span> statements. Consider the following:

<div class="code">

    if (a == 1)
      if (b == 2)
        doSomething(a, b);
    else
      somethingElse(a, b);

</div>

Based on the indentation, the person who wrote this code seemed to be
thinking that the <span class="code">somethingElse()</span> line would
be reached if <span class="code">a != 1</span>. But that isn't the case:
look more closely and you'll see that the <span class="code">else</span>
actually attaches to the *second* <span class="code">if</span>. An
<span class="code">else</span> always goes with the nearest possible
preceding <span class="code">if</span>. So this code will simply do
nothing if <span class="code">a != 1</span>.

To fix this, we have to add some braces to make the grouping explicit:

<div class="code">

    if (a == 1)
    {
      if (b == 2)
        doSomething(a, b);
    }
    else
      somethingElse(a, b);

</div>

This makes it impossible for the <span class="code">else</span> to
attach to the second <span class="code">if</span>, because the
<span class="code">if</span> is tucked away inside the nested code block
and therefore out of consideration back in the main code block.

### <span id="for">for</span>

The <span class="code">for</span> statement is a flexible and powerful
looping construct that lets you construct almost any kind of loop.

TADS has three different kinds of <span class="code">for</span> loops:
the standard C <span class="code">for</span> loop, which is very similar
to its counterpart in C++; the <span class="code">for..in</span> loop,
which works exactly like [<span class="code">foreach</span>](#foreach);
and the "range" loop, which makes it easy to write a loop over a range
of integer values.

#### <span id="cfor">C-style <span class="code">for</span> loops</span>

The basic <span class="code">for</span> loop in TADS is almost identical
to the {\[for}} loop in C, C++, Javascript, and most other C-like
languages. It has this basic syntax:

<div class="syntax">

    for ( [ initializer ]  ; [ condition ]  ; [ updater ]  )
      loopBody

</div>

The <span class="synPar">initializer</span> is either an ordinary
expression, or a list of local variable declarations, or a mix of both:

<div class="syntax">

    ( expression | local varName = expression )  [ , ... ] 

</div>

Note the difference from ordinary <span class="code">local</span>
statements: the initializer expression is *required* for a local
variable defined here.

Local variables defined in a <span class="code">for</span> statement are
only in scope within the <span class="code">for</span> loop. They're in
scope within all of the expressions that are part of the
<span class="code">for</span> statement itself (the initializer,
condition, and updater expressions), and they're in scope within the
body of the loop. The <span class="code">for</span> statement has its
own new nested scope that starts just before the
<span class="code">for</span> and ends at the end of its loop body; the
locals exist within this nested scope.

In practice, the expressions within the
<span class="synPar">initializer</span> section are almost always
assignment expressions. The point is to initialize the variables used
within the loop to their starting values for the loop.

The <span class="synPar">condition</span> and
<span class="synPar">updater</span> are ordinary expressions, and the
<span class="synPar">loopBody</span> is a single statement, or a block
of statements enclosed in braces.

The C-style <span class="code">for</span> statement executes as follows:

- 1\. Evaluate each element of the
  <span class="synPar">initializer</span> list, starting from the left.
- 2\. If there's a <span class="synPar">condition</span>, evaluate it.
  If result is 0 or <span class="code">nil</span>, we're done with the
  <span class="code">for</span>, so jump to the next statement after the
  loop body. Otherwise, proceed to step 3. If there's no
  <span class="synPar">condition</span>, proceed to step 3.
- 3\. Execute <span class="synPar">loopBody</span> once.
- 4\. Evaluate <span class="synPar">updater</span>, if specified.
- 5\. Go to step 2.

An important feature of this procedure is that the
<span class="synPar">condition</span> expression is evaluated *before
the first iteration*. That means that if the condition is false (i.e., 0
or <span class="code">nil</span>) before the first iteration, the loop
body is never executed. Therefore, it's possible for a
<span class="code">for</span> loop to iterate zero times.

Another feature to note is that the <span class="synPar">updater</span>
expression is evaluated *after each iteration*, before the
<span class="synPar">condition</span> is re-tested.

C-style <span class="code">for</span> statements are extremely flexible.
The statement doesn't do anything implicitly - it doesn't increment any
variables automatically, or anything else. This is a departure from many
programming languages, where similar looping constructs implicitly
increment a variable on each iteration. With the
<span class="code">for</span> statement, you have to explicitly say what
you want to do on each iteration. Although that's a little more work,
the benefit is that you can do exactly what you want, no matter how
unusual: if you want to increment a variable by the *n*th Fibonacci
number each time through, you can easily do that.

Note that each of the expression parts - the
<span class="synPar">initializer</span>, the
<span class="synPar">condition</span>, and the
<span class="synPar">updater</span> - are allowed to be completely
empty. You still have to write all of the semicolons, but it's legal to
write *only* the semicolons. This is a valid loop:

<div class="code">

    for (;;)
    {
      // do some work...
    }

</div>

Because there's no <span class="synPar">condition</span> expression,
this statement will loop forever, unless there's a statement within the
loop that exits the loop or the entire function (such as
<span class="code">break</span>, <span class="code">goto</span>,
<span class="code">return</span>, or <span class="code">throw</span>).

Here's a more typical example of a <span class="code">for</span> loop.

<div class="code">

    for (local i = 1 ; i &lt;= lst.length() ; ++i)
    {
      "lst[&lt;<i>&gt;] = &lt;&lt;lst[i]&gt;&gt;\n";
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

This loop goes through a list, displaying each element. It uses the
counter variable <span class="code">i</span> (defined as local to the
loop): it starts by setting <span class="code">i</span> to 1, and
continues looping as long as <span class="code">i</span> is less than or
equal to the length of the list; each time through the loop, it
increments <span class="code">i</span>, to move to the next list
element.

You could speed up this example a little bit by saving the length of the
list in another loop local variable. This takes advantage of the ability
to use more than one <span class="code">local</span> clause in a
<span class="code">for</span> initializer.

<div class="code">

    for (local i = 1, local len = lst.length() ; i &lt;= len ; ++i) ...

</div>

That works the same as our original example, but runs a little faster,
because it doesn't have to call <span class="code">lst.length()</span>
every time through the loop.

#### <span id="forIn">for..in</span>

The <span class="code">for</span> statement can alternatively iterate
over the elements of a collection. The syntax for this is exactly the
same as for the [<span class="code">foreach</span>](#foreach) statement,
other than using <span class="code">for</span> in place of
<span class="code">foreach</span>:

<div class="syntax">

    for ( [ local ]  loopVar in expression )
       loopBody

</div>

For..in loops are new in TADS 3.1; in older versions, only the
<span class="code">foreach</span> statement accepted this syntax. The
<span class="code">for</span> syntax was added for two reasons. First,
it simplifies the language's syntax: you don't have to remember to use a
different statement keyword for collection loops. Second, it lets you
[combine](#combinedFor) the collection syntax with the standard C-style
<span class="code">for</span> syntax, so that you can add other
variables (counters, sums, etc.) to a collection loop.

#### <span id="forInRange">for..in range</span>

The third type of <span class="code">for</span> loop iterates over a
range of integers. This is by far the most common type of
<span class="code">for</span> loop, so TADS provides this special syntax
to make the meaning a little clearer.

The syntax for an integer range loop is:

<div class="syntax">

    for ( [ local ]  loopVar in fromExpr .. toExpr [ step stepExpr ]  )
       loopBody

</div>

As with other <span class="code">for</span> loops, the
<span class="code">local</span> keyword lets you define a new local
variable for the loop's control variable, with its scope limited to the
loop. If you don't use <span class="code">local</span>, the loop
variable can be any local variable defined before the
<span class="code">for</span>.

*fromExpr*, *toExpr*, and the optional *stepExpr* are expressions that
evaluate to integer values. If there's no <span class="code">step</span>
clause, the default step value is 1.

The integer range loop is executed as follows:

- 1\. *fromExpr* is evaluated, and the result is assigned to *loopVar*.
- 2\. *toExpr* and (if it's present) *stepExpr* are evaluated, in that
  order, and the results are stored in temporary memory locations.
- 3\. *loopVar* is compared to the value of *toExpr* calculated in
  step 2. If the saved *stepExpr* is positive, we exit the loop if
  *loopVar* is the result is "greater than". If *stepExpr* was negative,
  we exit if the result is "less than". Otherwise we continue to step 4.
- 4\. Execute the loop body one time.
- 5\. Add the *stepExpr* value calculated in step 2 to *loopVar*.
- 6\. Go to step 3.

In step 3, note how the loop exits if the loop's control variable goes
*beyond* the *toExpr* limit, where the direction of "beyond" depends on
whether the step increment is positive or negative. If the step is
positive, we're looping from a lower value to a higher value, so we stop
when the loop variable is greater than the "to" limit. Likewise, if the
step is negative, we're going from a higher value to a lower value, so
we stop when the loop variable is less than the "to" limit.

Take special note of how *toExpr* and *stepExpr* are used in the loop.
They're only evaluated *once*, at the start of the loop (in step 2).
This is important, because it means that if any of these values change
during the loop, it doesn't affect the loop boundaries. The original
values at the start of the loop determine the loop's limits. Consider
this example:

<div class="code">

    local lst = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    for (local i in 1..lst.length())
       lst += lst[i];

</div>

Each time through this loop, we append a new element to the end of the
list. This means that <span class="code">lst.length()</span> increases
by 1 on each iteration. If we re-evaluated
<span class="code">lst.length()</span> each time through, this loop
would never end - both <span class="code">i</span> and
<span class="code">lst.length()</span> are incremented by 1 each time
through, so <span class="code">i</span> would never catch up with
<span class="code">lst.length()</span>. But we *don't* re-evaluate
<span class="code">lst.length()</span> each time through; instead, the
original value is calculated at the start of the loop, and that value is
used to determine when the loop ends, no matter what happens once we
start going through the loop. So the loop in this example runs only
three times, then exits.

The single evaluation of *toExpr* and *stepExpr* is also good for
efficiency. With traditional C-style loops, it's common to write
something like this:

<div class="code">

    for (local i = 1, local len = lst.length() ; i &lt;= len ; ++i) ...

</div>

The point of creating the extra local <span class="code">len</span> is
to speed up the code a little by avoiding a call to
<span class="code">lst.length()</span> every time through the loop. The
<span class="code">for..in</span> syntax is equally efficient, because
it does the same thing. It just saves you the trouble of coding the
extra step by hand, and makes the code easier to read.

#### <span id="combinedFor">Combining <span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">for..in</span>, and <span class="code">for..in range</span></span>

So far, we've presented the <span class="code">for</span> statement as
though it had three separate syntax options: the standard C-style
<span class="code">for</span>, the collection loop with
<span class="code">for (x in y)</span>, and the integer range loop with
<span class="code">for (i in a..b)</span>. These aren't actually
separate statement types, though - they're simply special cases of the
standard <span class="code">for</span>, which encompasses all three loop
styles. The really interesting thing is that you can combine all three
types in a single loop. For example:

<div class="code">

    for (local i = 1, local ele in lst ; ; ++i)
       "lst[&lt;<i>&gt;] = &lt;&lt;lst[i]&gt;&gt;\n";

&lt;/div&gt;

That kind of loop is cumbersome to write with
<span class="code">foreach</span>, since there's no way to include an
extra counter variable with the collection loop.
<span class="code">for</span>'s ability to combine the loop styles makes
for shorter code that's often clearer, since the extra variables
involved in the loop can be coded right into the
<span class="code">for</span> structure.

The key to combining the three types of <span class="code">for</span>
loops is that <span class="code">x in y</span> and <span class="code">i
in a..b</span> are really just syntax options for the "initializer"
clause of the C-style <span class="code">for</span> statement. You can
freely mix these with one another and with ordinary initializer
expressions.

When you use <span class="code">x in y</span> or <span class="code">i in
a..b</span> in an initializer, the condition and updater clauses of the
<span class="code">for</span> become optional. You can omit them
entirely, including the semicolons that separate the three clauses. The
<span class="code">for (x in y)</span> and <span class="code">for (i in
a..b)</span> statements we saw earlier, then, are nothing special:
they're just the simplest <span class="code">for</span> statements with
the respective initializer types. The reason that the condition and
updater clauses are optional when using an "in" clause is that an "in"
clause supplies its own implicit condition and updater - so if you have
nothing else to add to those parts, the compiler lets you leave them out
entirely, to keep the code uncluttered.

Here's the full sequence of events when processing a hybrid loop that
contains regular initializers, conditions, and updaters, as well as
<span class="code">in</span> clauses:

- 1\. For each initializer, in order of appearance:
  - If it's an ordinary expression, evaluate it.
  - If it's an <span class="code">x in y</span> clause, evaluate the
    *collection* expression, then call the
    <span class="code">createIterator()</span> method on the result.
    Store the method result in a temporary memory location ("the
    iterator").
  - If it's an <span class="code">i in a..b</span> clause, evaluate the
    *fromExpr*, and assign the result to the control variable. Then,
    evaluate *toExpr* and (if present) *stepExpr*, and store the results
    in temporary memory locations.
- 2\. For each <span class="code">in</span> clause among the
  initializers, in order of appearance:
  - For an <span class="code">x in y</span> clause, call the
    <span class="code">isNextAvailable()</span> method on the iterator.
    If it returns <span class="code">nil</span>, exit the loop.
    Otherwise call the iterator's <span class="code">getNext()</span>
    method and store the result in the clause's *loopVar*.
  - For an <span class="code">i in a..b</span> clause, compare the
    clause's *loopVar* to the saved value of *toExpr* from step 1. If
    it's "beyond" the *toExpr* value (greater than *toExpr* if the step
    value is positive, less than *toExpr* if the step value is
    negative), exit the loop.
- 3\. If there's a *condition* expression, evaluate it. If the result is
  <span class="code">0</span> or <span class="code">nil</span>, exit the
  loop.
- 4\. Execute the loop body once.
- 5\. If there's an *updater* expression, evaluate it.
- 6\. For each <span class="code">i in a..b</span> clause (in the order
  of the initializers), add the saved value of *stepExpr* from step 1 to
  *loopVar*.
- 7\. Go to step 2.

In a nutshell, this works just like the standard C
<span class="code">for</span> loop, except for two additions. First,
**before** the explicit *condition* expression is tested,
<span class="code">x in y</span> and <span class="code">i in a..b</span>
clauses are tested, and the loop terminates if any of them are finished.
Second, **after** the explicit *updater* expression is executed,
<span class="code">i in a..b</span> loop control variables are
incremented by their step values. The explicit *updater* is executed
first so that it can refer to the current values of the
<span class="code">in</span> control variables, from the loop iteration
that just finished, if desired.

### <span id="foreach">foreach</span>

The <span class="code">foreach</span> statement iterates over a
Collection object's contents. It executes a statement (or group of
statements) once for each element of a Collection.

<div class="syntax">

    foreach ( loopVar in expression )
      loopBody

</div>

<span class="synPar">loopVar</span> can take one of two forms: it can be
any "lvalue" (see the [expressions](expr.html#commonEles) section for
details), such as a local variable, an object property, or an indexed
lvalue; or it can be of this form:

<div class="syntax">

    local localName

</div>

The <span class="code">local</span> syntax defines a new local variable,
scoped to the <span class="code">foreach</span> statement. (This works
the same way as it does with the <span class="code">for</span>
statement.) If the <span class="code">local</span> keyword is not
specified, the local variable with the given name from the enclosing
scope is used.

The <span class="synPar">expression</span> is any expression, but when
evaluated it must yield a Collection object - a list, a Vector, or a
LookupTable.

The <span class="synPar">loopBody</span> is a single statement, or a
group of statements enclosed in braces.

The statement first evaluates the
<span class="synPar">expression</span>. This must yield a Collection
object; if not, a run-time error results. The statement then iterates
over the elements of the collection, one at a time. For each element of
the collection, the statement sets the looping variable
<span class="synPar">loopVar</span> to the current element, and executes
the <span class="synPar">loopBody</span> once.

For a mutable object like a Vector or a HashTable,
<span class="code">foreach</span> automatically creates a "safe" copy of
the object at the beginning of the iteration, and uses the safe copy
throughout the iteration. This ensures that the loop executes exactly
once for each element of the collection *as it was at the start of the
loop*, even if the loop body makes changes to the collection. This makes
it safe to make arbitrary changes to the collection in the loop body.
For example, you can insert new element into a Vector, or delete
existing elements. Changes you make from within the loop body will not
affect the iteration.

The order of the iteration depends on the type of the collection. For
lists and Vectors, the iteration is in ascending index order. For
LookupTables, the order is arbitrary.

The "element" value that's assigned to the looping variable on each
iteration depends on the type of collection. For a list or a Vector,
it's simply the element value. For a LookupTable, it's the *value* at a
given key, *not* the key itself.

Example:

<div class="code">

    foreach (local ele in lst)
      "&lt;<ele>&gt;... ";

&lt;/div&gt;

This simply runs through a collection and displays each element.
Assuming <span class="code">lst</span> is a list, the elements are
displayed in ascending index order.

Here's an example that takes advantage of the "snapshot" feature - the
safe copy that <span class="code">foreach</span> creates before
beginning the iteration.

<div class="code">

    local i = 1;
    local vec = new Vector(10).fillValue(nil, 1, 10).applyAll({x: i++});

    foreach (local x in vec)
    {
      vec.applyAll({v: v+1});
      "&lt;<x>&gt;\n";
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

The first two lines create a Vector and initialize its elements to the
integers 1 through 10, using the <span class="code">applyAll()</span>
method of the Vector. The <span class="code">foreach</span> body
modifies the entire Vector, by adding 1 to each element, then prints out
the current value. At first glance, we might expect the values displayed
to be something like this: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...; we might expect this
because of the <span class="code">applyAll()</span> call updates every
element of the Vector on every iteration of the loop. This isn't what
happens, though: because the <span class="code">foreach</span> iterates
a copy of the Vector, we actually print out the original contents of the
Vector: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. After we're finished with the iteration,
though, if we look at the Vector, we'll find it modified as we'd expect.
In addition, even within the loop, if we were to refer directly to the
Vector through the variable <span class="code">vec</span>, we'd find it
modified as we'd expect - the snapshot pertains only the iteration
variable, and doesn't "freeze" the Vector itself. To see this, consider
this more complex example:

<div class="code">

    local i = 1;
    local vec = new Vector(10).fillValue(0, 1, 10).applyAll({x: i++});

    i = 1;
    foreach (local x in vec)
    {
      vec.applyAll({v: v+1});
      "x = &lt;<x>&gt;, vec[&lt;<i>&gt;] = &lt;&lt;vec[i]&gt;&gt;\n";
      ++i;
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

This would display the following, showing that the vector has been
modified - and the modifications are visible within the loop - even
though the modifications are not visible to the iteration variable:

<div class="code">

    x = 1, vec[1] = 2
    x = 2, vec[2] = 4
    x = 3, vec[3] = 6
    x = 4, vec[4] = 8
    x = 5, vec[5] = 10
    x = 6, vec[6] = 12
    x = 7, vec[7] = 14
    x = 8, vec[8] = 16
    x = 9, vec[9] = 18
    x = 10, vec[10] = 20

</div>

Although we've belabored this snapshot behavior as though it were some
pitfall you must take care to avoid, the snapshot actually simplifies
things greatly for most common situations. The snapshot relieves you
from having to worry about how the iteration will proceed. Even if
you're making changes to the contents of the collection during the loop,
you can be confident that the updates will have no effect on the
iteration. The snapshot feature makes it easy to iterate over
collections without having to worry about the details of how changes
would affect the order of the elements, or the number of elements, or
anything else.

For those who are curious, here are the gory, internal details on how
<span class="code">foreach</span> actually executes. It first evaluates
the <span class="synPar">expression</span>, then calls the
<span class="code">createIterator()</span> method on the resulting
value. It stores this value in a temporary variable, which we'll call
*I*. It then loops as follows: call
*I*<span class="code">.isNextAvailable()</span>; if this is
<span class="code">nil</span>, exit the loop; otherwise call
*I*<span class="code">.getNext()</span>, and assign the result to the
looping variable <span class="synPar">loopVar</span>, then execute the
loop body once, then go to the top of the loop.

### <span id="while">while</span>

The <span class="code">while</span> statement sets up a simple loop that
repeats as long as a condition is true.

<div class="syntax">

    while ( conditionExpression )
       loopBody

</div>

The <span class="synPar">conditionExpression</span> is any expression,
and the <span class="synPar">loopBody</span> is a single statement or a
group of statements enclosed in braces.

A <span class="code">while</span> statement is executed as follows:

- 1\. Evaluate the condition expression. If the result is 0 or
  <span class="code">nil</span>, exit the loop, by jumping to the next
  statement after the loop body. Otherwise, proceed to step 2.
- 2\. Execute the loop body once.
- 3\. Go to step 1.

The condition expression is evaluated before every iteration of the
loop - even before the first iteration, which means that the loop can
execute zero times, if the condition is initially false.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    local iter = coll.createIterator();
    while (iter.isNextAvail())
    {
      local ele = iter.getNext();
      "The next element is: &lt;<ele>&gt;\n";
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

### <span id="dowhile">do...while</span>

The <span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span>
statement sets up a loop similar to a <span class="code">while</span>
loop, but with the important difference that the loop condition is
tested *after* each iteration, rather than at the beginning. This means
that a <span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span>
loop always executes *at least once*, since the loop condition isn't
tested until after the first iteration.

<div class="syntax">

    do
      loopBody
    while ( conditionExpression ) ;

</div>

The <span class="synPar">conditionExpression</span> is any expression,
and the <span class="synPar">loopBody</span> is one statement or a group
of statements enclosed in braces.

A <span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span> loop is
executed as follows:

- 1\. Execute the loop body once.
- 2\. Evaluate the condition expression. If the result is 0 or nil, exit
  the loop by jumping to the next statement after the
  <span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span>.
  Otherwise, go to step 1.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    local x = 'a';
    do
    {
        "x = &lt;<a>&gt;\n";
        x += 'a';
    } while (a.length() &lt; 10);

&lt;/div&gt;

### <span id="switch">switch</span>

The <span class="code">switch</span> statement selects one of several
code branches, depending on the value of an expression.
<span class="code">switch</span> is similar to a series of
<span class="code">if</span>...<span class="code">else
if</span>...<span class="code">else if</span>... statements, but has
some advantages and restrictions over that approach.

<div class="syntax">

    switch ( controlExpression )
    {
      case value1 :
        caseBody1

      case value2 :
        caseBody2

      default :
        defaultBody
    }

</div>

The <span class="synPar">controlExpression</span> is any expression.
This is used to select which "branch" of the
<span class="code">switch</span> to execute.

<span class="synPar">value1</span> and subsequent values are called the
"case labels." These are **constant** expressions - that is, they must
be integers, enums, object names, string constants, property IDs,
function names, BigNumber constants, or lists containing only constant
expressions. These values can be expressions, as long as the expression
can be fully computed and reduced to a constant value at compile time.
For example, you can use a value like <span class="code">1+2\*3</span>,
since the compiler can directly compute the integer value of this
expression; but you can't use a value like
<span class="code">a+1</span>, where <span class="code">a</span> is a
local variable, because the value of a local variable can't be
determined until the program is actually running. You can use any mix of
types among the case labels - that is, each case label can be of a
different datatype.

The <span class="synPar">caseBody</span> elements, and the
<span class="synPar">defaultBody</span>, each consist of zero or more
statements. Note that it's legal for a case or default body to be empty,
so it's legal for several <span class="code">case</span> labels to
appear consecutively.

A <span class="code">switch</span> must have at least one
<span class="code">case</span> *or*. <span class="code">default</span>
label, and can have at most one <span class="code">default</span> label.
Any number of <span class="code">case</span> labels can appear -
including zero, provided there's a <span class="code">default</span> to
meet the required minimum of one label overall. So, for example, a
<span class="code">switch</span> that contains only a
<span class="code">default</span> label is legal, as is a
<span class="code">switch</span> with one <span class="code">case</span>
label, or with five <span class="code">case</span> labels, or with
<span class="code">five</span> case labels and a
<span class="code">default</span>. A completely empty
<span class="code">switch</span> is illegal, as is a
<span class="code">switch</span> with more than one
<span class="code">default</span> label.

A <span class="code">switch</span> statement is executed as follows.
First, the <span class="synPar">controlExpression</span> is evaluated.
The result is then compared to each case label value, one at a time, in
the order in which the labels appear in the source code. The comparison
is done according to the same rules as the <span class="code">==</span>
operator. At the first match, execution jumps to the first
<span class="synPar">caseBody</span> statement following the matching
label. If no matches are found among the case labels, and there's a
<span class="code">default</span> label, execution jumps to the first
<span class="synPar">defaultBody</span> statement. If no matches are
found among the case labels, and there's no
<span class="code">default</span> label, execution jumps to the next
statement after the entire <span class="code">switch</span> body.

Note that the <span class="code">default</span> can go anywhere in the
<span class="code">switch</span> without changing the behavior of the
<span class="code">switch</span>. We always search *all* of the value
labels first, and only jump to the <span class="code">default</span>
label if we can't find a match. So you can even put the
<span class="code">default</span> label first if you want - it won't
change anything, since the value labels are always checked first, no
matter where the <span class="code">default</span> appears.

<span id="caseBreaks">Warning! <span class="code">break</span> must be
explicit!</span>

It's very important to note that a <span class="code">case</span> label
**does not** interrupt the flow of execution after a match has been
found. In other words, the case bodies are **not** like
<span class="code">if</span>...<span class="code">else</span> branches,
where execution leaves the overall statement when you reach the end of
the branch. Instead, they're like <span class="code">goto</span> labels,
where they just drop you into a linear sequence of code at a particular
point - and once you're there, you'll by default just keep going all the
way to the end of the <span class="code">switch</span>, even if you
encounter other <span class="code">case</span> labels along the way.

This is a feature of C that's inherited by most C-like languages,
including TADS, and it catches a lot of people off-guard. Many
procedural languages outside the C-like family have similar "selection"
statements that *do* work like multi-branch if-then-else trees, and to
most people that's the obvious, intuitive way of doing things. This is
probably one of the most counterintuitive aspects of C, and a common
pitfall for new C (and Java and TADS) programmers.

Fortunately, you *can* make each case block a self-contained little
branch, just like an
<span class="code">if</span>...<span class="code">else</span> - it's
just that you have to do so *explicitly*. The way you do this is by
adding a <span class="code">break</span> statement at the end of each
case body.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    switch (obj.color)
    {
    case red:
      lambda = 700;
      break;

    case orange:
      lambda = 600;
      break;

    case yellow:
      lambda = 575;
      break;

    default:
      lambda = 0;
      break;
    }

</div>

Here, we've made each case body a self-contained branch by putting a
<span class="code">break</span> statement at the end. A
<span class="code">break</span> within a
<span class="code">switch</span> body jumps to the next statement after
the end of the <span class="code">switch</span>, so for each color case,
we'll just set the wavelength variable and leave the
<span class="code">switch</span>.

Note that we've even put a <span class="code">break</span> at the very
end, as the last statement of the <span class="code">default</span>
body. There's no subtle magic behind this - it's presence changes
nothing, exactly as you'd expect, since if we left it out we'd still
fall out of the end of the overall <span class="code">switch</span> body
at that same point anyway. So why did we bother to write the
<span class="code">break</span> there? There are a few reasons. One is
that it's a good habit to just automatically end each case branch with a
<span class="code">break</span>, since if you get into that habit you're
less likely to miss one accidentally when it matters. Another is that it
makes the code look a little more consistent, since each branch has the
same form: <span class="code">case</span>, code,
<span class="code">break</span>. Perhaps the most important reason is
that it's a little insurance in case we add another case label below the
<span class="code">default</span> later on - at that point we might
forget that there's a case above that we didn't
<span class="code">break</span> out of, so adding the
<span class="code">break</span> now ensures that we won't miss it then.

You might wonder how the designers of C ever came up with the crazy
"fall-through" feature in the first place. It's probably a result of C's
design as a thinly disguised version of assembly language. In assembler,
labels are just targets for "goto" jumps. The use of the label-like
syntax for the cases suggests that C's designers conceived of "switch"
as a fancy "goto". If you think of the case labels as just "goto"
targets, then, it makes a kind of sense that execution just plows on
through them rather than leaving the switch at the end of a case.

The fall-through behavior is handy for one thing, though. It lets you
easily share the same case body among multiple labels:

<div class="code">

    switch (x)
    {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
      "x is from 1 to 5\n";
      break;

    case 6:
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
    case 10:
      "x is from 6 to 10\n";
      break;
    }

</div>

This code works because the empty case bodies (for cases 1, 2, 3, etc.)
all "fall through" to the next executable statement, even though there
are intervening case labels.

On some occasions, it's also convenient to take advantage of the
fall-through feature with actual executable code.

<div class="code">

    switch (x)
    {
    case 1:
      "one...";

    case 2:
      "x is one or two\n";
      break;
    }

</div>

In this case, we're *intentionally* falling through from the "1" case to
the "2" case. There's a little extra code we want to execute in the "1"
case, but then we want to proceed to the common handling for 1 and 2.
When you write code like this, it's not a bad idea to comment that the
fall-through is intentional - if you don't, and you come back to this
code after a couple of weeks, you might forget what you had in mind and
mistakenly think you forgot a <span class="code">break</span>, and
mistakenly fix a non-mistake! So, something like this is a good idea:

<div class="code">

    case 1:
      "one...";
      // FALL THROUGH...

    case 2:
      // etc...

</div>

<span id="indentStyle">A note on indentation styles</span>

There are basically two ways to indent <span class="code">switch</span>
bodies. Some people like to indent the case labels one level in from the
<span class="code">switch</span>, and then indent the statements in the
case bodies one level further:

<div class="code">

    switch (x)
    {
      case 1:
        "One!";
        break;

      case 2:
        "Two!";
        break;

      default:
        "A million!";
        break;
    }

</div>

Other people, your author included, prefer to put the labels at the same
level as the <span class="code">switch</span>:

<div class="code">

    switch (x)
    {
    case 1:
      "One!";
      break;

    case 2:
      // etc
    }

</div>

Both styles are common. I prefer the second because it makes for
slightly less indenting overall, which can be helpful in complex
functions; and because it treats the case labels consistently with
ordinary statement ("goto") labels, which I like to "outdent" from the
code they're labeling.

### <span id="goto">goto</span>

The <span class="code">goto</span> statement transfers the execution
position directly to a labeled statement.

<div class="syntax">

    goto label ;

</div>

The <span class="synPar">label</span> is the name of a statement label
defined elsewhere within the same function or method. The target label
can be within an enclosing code block, since statement labels are
visible within the entire containing function or method.

When a <span class="code">goto</span> statement is executed, the VM
first executes the <span class="code">finally</span> clause of each
enclosing <span class="code">try</span> statement, working from the
innermost outward. It then jumps directly to the statement immediately
following the target label.

Almost anyone who's had any exposure to programming in any language has
received the standard warnings about how bad
<span class="code">goto</span> is. This is generally true:
<span class="code">goto</span> is to be avoided. The problem with
<span class="code">goto</span> is that it makes it extremely difficult
to grasp the flow of execution through a piece of code by making
arbitrary jumps. The sort of nested conditional and iteration structures
that modern languages offer
(<span class="code">if</span>...<span class="code">else</span>,
<span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">while</span>, and so
on) are much easier to comprehend at a glance, since their visual
structure on the page maps fairly directly to their code flow.
<span class="code">goto</span> tends to ruin that clean visual structure
by scribbling arbitrary transfer vectors all over the page.

Even so, in C and C++, <span class="code">goto</span> is occasionally
the clearest way to accomplish a task. The alternative is sometimes to
create a network of extra flags that shepherd the execution point out of
a series of nested loops and into a subsequent cleanup section. However,
the ability in TADS 3 to use labeled targets in
<span class="code">break</span> and <span class="code">continue</span>
statements largely eliminates even this type of situation, so justified
uses of <span class="code">goto</span> in TADS 3 programs are rare
indeed.

### <span id="break">break</span>

The <span class="code">break</span> statement exits a given statement,
transferring control to the next statement after the given statement.

<div class="syntax">

    break [ label ]  ;

</div>

<span class="code">break</span> comes in two forms: with and without a
target label.

When no label is specified, <span class="code">break</span> applies to
the nearest enclosing <span class="code">for</span>,
<span class="code">while</span>,
<span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span>, or
<span class="code">switch</span> statement. There must be an enclosing
statement of one of these types in the current function or method; if
there isn't, a compiler error results. Controls transfers to the
statement immediately after the end of the loop or
<span class="code">switch</span> body.

When a label is specified, the <span class="code">break</span> applies
to the labeled statement, which must enclose the
<span class="code">break</span>. If the labeled statement doesn't
enclose the <span class="code">break</span>, a compiler error results.
If the target statement is a loop, control transfers to the statement
following the loop body. If the target is a compound statement (a group
of statements enclosed in braces), control transfers to the next
statement after the block's closing brace.

Targeted <span class="code">break</span> statements are especially
useful when you want to break out of a loop from within a nested
<span class="code">switch</span>:

<div class="code">

    scanLoop:
      for (i = 1 ; i &lt; 10 ; ++i)
      {
        switch(val[i])
        {
        case '+':
          ++sum;
          break;

        case '-':
          --sum;
          break;

        case 'eof':
          break scanLoop;
        }
      }

</div>

The label is necessary in this case because the
<span class="code">break</span> would, by default, only go as far as
exiting the <span class="code">switch</span>. By specifying the label,
you can break all the way out of the enclosing
<span class="code">for</span> loop.

Targeted break statements are also useful for breaking out of nested
loops:

<div class="code">

    matchLoop:
      for (i = 1 ; i &lt;= val.length() ; ++i)
      {
        for (j = 1 ; j &lt; i ; ++j)
        {
          if (val[i] == val[j])
            break matchLoop;
        }
      }

</div>

A labeled <span class="code">break</span> can break out of *any* block
of code - it doesn't have to be a loop or a
<span class="code">switch</span>. For example:

<div class="code">

    section1:
      {
        if (a == 1)
        {
          if (b == 2)
          {
            if (c == 3)
              break section1;

            // do some work...
          }

          // do something else...
        }

        // do some more stuff...
      }
      // that 'break section1' comes directly here

</div>

This is sometimes handy for error handling and the like, since it lets
you bypass a whole chunk of code by jumping directly out of the entire
labeled block.

### <span id="continue">continue</span>

The <span class="code">continue</span> statement bypasses the remainder
of a loop body, and jumps directly to the start of the next iteration of
the loop.

<div class="syntax">

    continue [ label ]  ;

</div>

If no label is specified, the <span class="code">continue</span>
implicitly refers to the nearest enclosing
<span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">while</span>, or
<span class="code">do...while</span> loop.

If a label is specified, the label must be associated with an enclosing
<span class="code">for</span>, <span class="code">foreach</span>,
<span class="code">while</span>, or <span class="code">do</span>
statement. The target statement of the
<span class="code">continue</span> is the labeled loop in this case.

Note that, in contrast to <span class="code">break</span>, a
<span class="code">continue</span> statement's label **must** be
associated with a loop of some kind (<span class="code">for</span>,
<span class="code">foreach</span>, <span class="code">while</span>, or
<span class="code">do...while</span>).

<span class="code">continue</span> transfers control to the "next
iteration" of the targeted loop statement. The exact point depends on
the type of that loop:

- If it's a <span class="code">for</span> loop, control transfers to the
  "updater" expression. That is, immediately after the
  <span class="code">continue</span> is executed, the
  <span class="code">for</span> evaluates its "updater" expression, then
  then evaluates its "condition" expression and uses the result to
  determine whether or not to perform another iteration of the loop
  body.
- If it's a <span class="code">foreach</span> loop, the next element of
  the Collection is fetched into the iteration variable, and control is
  transferred back to the top of the loop body (unless the Collection
  has been exhausted, in which case the loop terminates as normal).
- If it's a <span class="code">while</span> or
  <span class="code">do</span>...<span class="code">while</span> loop,
  control transfers to the condition evaluation. That is, immediately
  after the <span class="code">continue</span> statement, the loop
  evaluates its condition expression, and uses the result to determine
  whether or not to perform another iteration of the loop body.

Here's an example:

<div class="code">

    for (local i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; ++i)
    {
      "i = &lt;<i>&gt;\n";
      if (i &lt; 5)
        continue;

      "*** i is at least 5!\n";
    }

&lt;/div&gt;

### <span id="throw">throw</span>

The <span class="code">throw</span> statement "throws an exception."
That is, given an Exception object, the statement transfers control to
the nearest enclosing <span class="code">catch</span> handler for that
class of Exception.

<div class="syntax">

    throw expression ;

</div>

The <span class="synPar">expression</span> is most often of the form
<span class="code">new E()</span>, where <span class="code">E</span> is
some Exception subclass. However, any expression that yields an
Exception instance is valid here, and it's frequently useful to use
<span class="code">throw</span> with a local variable that contains a
previously caught Exception instance, or simply a static Exception
instance.

Refer to the section on [exception handling](except.html) for more
details on <span class="code">try</span> and
<span class="code">throw</span>.

### <span id="try">try</span>

The <span class="code">try</span> statement sets up an exception handler
for the duration of the enclosed block of code, which is referred to as
the code "protected" by the <span class="code">try</span>. This allows
you to catch and handle selected exceptions that are thrown from within
the protected code, or from any code that it calls via function and
method calls.

<div class="syntax">

    try
    {
      protectedCode
    }
    catch ( exceptionClass exceptionLocal )
    {
      handlerCode
    }
    catch ( exceptionClass exceptionLocal )
    {
      handlerCode
    }
    finally
    {
      finallyCode
    }

</div>

The <span class="synPar">protectedCode</span> consists of any number of
statements. This is the code that the <span class="code">try</span>
protects: if a handled exception is thrown from within this code or any
other functions or methods it calls, control is transfered to the first
statement of the body of the first <span class="code">catch</span>
clause whose <span class="synPar">exceptionClass</span> equals or is a
superclass of the thrown exception.

A <span class="code">try</span> can have zero or more
<span class="code">catch</span> clauses.

Within each <span class="code">catch</span> clause, the
<span class="synPar">exceptionClass</span> is the name of an Exception
subclass, indicating which type of exception(s) this clause handles. The
<span class="synPar">exceptionLocal</span> is a symbol that will be
defined as a new local variable, which is scoped to the
<span class="code">catch</span> clause. (That is, the variable will be
visible only within that <span class="code">catch</span> clause, and
hides any variable of the same name that's defined in any enclosing
scope.) The <span class="synPar">handlerCode</span> is any number of
statements; this block of code comprises the handler for the specified
exception.

The <span class="code">finally</span> clause is optional. If it's
present, only one is allowed, and it must follow all of the
<span class="code">catch</span> clauses. The
<span class="synPar">finallyCode</span> consists of any number of
statements; this block of code comprises the "finally" handler for the
protected code.

When an exception occurs within the protected code, the VM searches the
<span class="code">try</span> statement for a
<span class="code">catch</span> handler that "matches" the exception
actually thrown. A handler matches the thrown exception is the exception
equals the <span class="synPar">exceptionClass</span> named in the
handler, or the thrown exception is a subclass of the named class. The
VM searches the <span class="code">catch</span> clauses in order,
starting at the first (top) handler:

- If the VM finds a matching <span class="code">catch</span> handler, it
  stores a reference to the thrown exception in the
  <span class="synPar">exceptionLocal</span> local variable named in
  that <span class="code">catch</span> clause, then transfers control to
  the first statement of the <span class="synPar">handlerCode</span> of
  that <span class="code">catch</span> clause. At this point, the VM
  considers the exception completely handled.
- If the VM fails to find a matching <span class="code">catch</span>
  handler after searching all of the <span class="code">catch</span>
  clauses, it "re-throws" the exception. This means that it looks for
  the next enclosing <span class="code">try</span> block within the
  enclosing method, and failing that looks for the next enclosing block
  in the calling method, and that method's caller, and so on. Upon
  finding the enclosing <span class="code">try</span>, the VM repeats
  the <span class="code">catch</span> search with the new
  <span class="code">try</span>.

The <span class="code">finally</span> block, if specified, contains code
that will be executed when control transfers out of the protected
<span class="code">try</span> code, *no matter how that transfer
occurs.* Control can transfer out of the protected
<span class="code">try</span> code due to:

- A <span class="code">goto</span> that targets a label outside of the
  protected code
- A <span class="code">break</span> that leaves the protected code
- A <span class="code">continue</span> that resumes a loop enclosing the
  protected code
- A <span class="code">return</span> from within the protected code
- A <span class="code">throw</span> from within the protected code
- Simply "falling off the end" of the protected code

If a <span class="code">catch</span> handler catches an exception thrown
within the protected code, the <span class="code">finally</span> clause
will *still* run - as promised, it *always* runs when control exits the
<span class="code">try</span>, no matter how. In this case, the
<span class="code">finally</span> clause will run when control transfers
*out* of the <span class="code">catch</span> handler. Control can
transfer out of the <span class="code">catch</span> handler in any of
the ways listed above for the main protected code; the
<span class="code">finally</span> will be invoked at that time for any
of those modes of egress.

For more details on <span class="code">try</span> and
<span class="code">throw</span>, refer to the section on [exception
handling](except.html).

## <span id="tads2">Notes for TADS 2 users</span>

TADS 2 users should note some important syntax changes from the old
language:

- The TADS 2 function definition syntax is no longer supported. Instead,
  TADS 3 uses a syntax that's much like Java's or C's. This makes the
  language more internally consistent.
- Method definitions are also slightly different from TADS 2's syntax.
  In particular, the <span class="code">=</span> (equals sign) that came
  between a method's parameter list and its body is no longer allowed.
  This makes method definitions look much more like they do in Java and
  C++.

TADS 3 lifts a number of restrictions that TADS 2 imposed. Some of the
more important ones:

- In TADS 3, forward function declarations are never required. The
  compiler processes the entire program's source code before resolving
  symbols, so it looks ahead by itself and requires no explicit forward
  declarations.
- TADS 3 lets you use empty parentheses to call a method that takes no
  parameters. This is exactly equivalent to calling the method with no
  argument list (that is, no parentheses) at all.
- You can define local variables anywhere in a code block in TADS 3.
  That is, a <span class="code">local</span> statement can go anywhere a
  regular executable statement can go. The TADS 2 restriction, that
  <span class="code">local</span> statements could only go at the top of
  a code block, no longer applies.

&lt;/div&gt;
