An Achievement is an object used to award points in the score. For most
purposes, an achievement can be described simply by a string, but the
Achievement object provides more flexibility in describing combined
scores when a set of similar achievements are to be grouped.

There are two ways to use the scoring system.

1\. You can use a mix of string names and Achievement objects for
scoring items; each time you award a scoring item, you call the function
addToScore() to specify the achievement (by name or by Achievement
object) and the number of points to award. You can also call the method
addToScoreOnce() on an Achievement object to award the scoring item,
ensuring that the item is only awarded once in the entire game (saving
you the trouble of checking to see if the event that triggered the
scoring item has happened before already in the same game). If you do
this, you MUST set the property gameMain.maxScore to reflect the maximum
score possible in the game.

2\. You can use EXCLUSIVELY Achievement objects to represents scoring
items, and give each Achievement object a 'points' property indicating
the number of points it's worth. To award a scoring item, you call the
method awardPoints() on an Achievement object. If you use this style of
scoring, the library AUTOMATICALLY computes the gameMain.maxScore value,
by adding up the 'points' values of all of the Achievement objects in
the game. For this to work properly, you have to obey the following
rules:

  
- use ONLY Achievement objects (never strings) to award points;  
- set the 'points' property of each Achievement to its score;  
- define Achievement objects statically only (never use 'new' to  
create an Achievement dynamically)  
- if an Achievement can be awarded more than once, you must override  
its 'maxPoints' property to reflect the total number of points it  
will be worth when it is awarded the maximum number of times;  
- always award an Achievement through its awardPoints() or  
awardPointsOnce() method;  
- there exists at least one solution of the game in which every  
Achievement object is awarded

Describe the achievement - this must display a string explaining the
reason the points associated with this achievement were awarded.

Note that this description can make use of the scoreCount information to
show different descriptions depending on how many times the item has
scored. For example, an achievement for finding various treasure items
might want to display "finding a treasure" if only one treasure was
found and "finding five treasures" if five were found.

In some cases, it might be desirable to keep track of additional custom
information, and use that information in generating the description. For
example, the game might keep a list of treasures found with the
achievement, adding to the list each time the achievement is scored, and
displaying the contents of the list when the description is shown.
