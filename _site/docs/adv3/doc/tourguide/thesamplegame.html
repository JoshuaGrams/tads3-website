<p>The Sample Game we shall be developing together is whimsically called
<em>The Quest of the Golden Banana</em>. There is nothing stunningly original
in its design, and it will probably strike you as Dr Who meets the Lord
of the Rings with a hint of old-fashioned text adventures like <em>Zork</em>
thrown in for good measure. For our purposes, however, its contrived
nature is an advantage, since it allows us to set up of sorts of
implausible situations and puzzles that can put the TADS 3 library
through its paces.</p>

<p>To give a brief summary of the game (which you might want to try playing
before getting to work on this Tour Guide), you (i.e. the Player
Character) start outside the entrance of a cave. The only way to go is
in, and once you’re in there’s a rockfall that blocks the only obvious
way out. To complete the game you need to fulfil two objectives: (1)
locate the Golden Banana and cast it into Mount Gloom to prevent its
falling into the hands of the dreaded Cabal, and (2) help the young
woman you’ll quickly encounter to get back out of the cave (i.e. both
you and the woman must arrive back at the starting location). To fulfil
the first objective you need to sail a ship round an underground lake to
various destinations; to fulfil the second you need to get a TARDIS back
in full working order: you’ll also need the TARDIS to fulfil the first
objective, traveling to locations as disparate as King Solomon’s palace
three thousand years in the past to an abandoned space station a
thousand years in the future.</p>
