<p>The Shuffled event list is just like a random event list, except that it
fires its events in a “shuffled” order rather than an independently
random order. “Shuffled order” means that events are fired in random
order; once an event is fired it is not fired again until all of the
other events have been fired. The effect is similar to dealing from a
pack (UK) / deck (USA) of cards.</p>

<p>For the first time through the main list, the strings are normally
shuffled immediately at startup, but this is optional. If
<strong>shuffleFirst</strong> is set to nil, the events will <em>not</em> be shuffled the
first time through; they’ll be run through once in the order listed,
then shuffled for the next time through, then shuffled again for the
next, and so on. So, if you want a specific order for the first time
through, just define the list in the desired order and set shuffleFirst
to nil.</p>

<p>You can optionally specify a separate list of one-time-only sequential
strings in the property <strong>firstEvents</strong>. This list of events will be run
through once, much like a standard <a href="eventlist.html">EventList</a>. Once
they’ve been exhausted, the ShuffledEventList will switch to the main
eventList list, showing it one time through in its given order, then
shuffling it and running through it again, and so on. The firstEvents
list is never shuffled - it’s always shown in exactly the order given.
This combination of a list in a fixed order followed by a list which
gets shuffled is particularly useful in connexion with
<a href="topicentry.html">TopicEntries</a>, when you want an NPC to give a specific
sequence of responses (probably conveying relatively important
information), followed by a series of randomly-ordered responses
(perhaps indicating that the NPC has nothing further to say on the
subject).</p>

<p>We saw an example of a ShuffledEventList right at the start in the
definition of our first <a href="outdoorroom.html">OutdoorRoom</a>, where we used
one for the atmosphere list. We’ll also be encountering examples in
connection with <a href="asktopic.html">AskTopic</a>,
<a href="askaboutfortopic.html">AskForAboutTopic</a>,
<a href="defaultasktopic.html">DefaultAskTopic</a>,
<a href="defaulttelltopic.html">DefaultTellTopic</a>,
<a href="defaultasktelltopic.html">DefaultAskTellTopic</a>, and most of the other
DefaultTopics.</p>

<p>The ShuffledEventList has its own
<a href="shuffledeventlisttemplate.html">template</a> to allow easy definition of
its firstEvents and eventList properties.</p>

<p>Since ShuffledEventList inherits from
<a href="randomfiringscript.html">RandomFiringScript</a>, it can also use the same
eventPercent, eventReduceTo, and eventReduceAfter properties that were
described on <a href="randomeventlist.html">RandomEventList</a>.</p>
