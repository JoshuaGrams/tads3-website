<p>Most objects that are lockable are also likely to be openable - after
all, there’s not a lot of point in locking or unlocking an object that
can’t be open or closed. However, since most of the objects that are
openable and closable tend to be container-like objects or door-like
objects, in practice one tends to use classes like <a href="door.html">Door</a> and
<a href="openablecontainer.html">OpenableContainer</a> rather more than a bare
Openable. We are not yet ready to introduce an example of a bare
Openable in our test game, but there is one later, the
<a href="presentlater.html">tardisPanel</a> object.</p>

<p>The Openable class inherits all the behaviour of
<a href="basicopenable.html">BasicOpenable</a> and the mainly adds handling (or at
least additional preconditions) for a number of common verbs (OPEN,
CLOSE, PUT IN, POUR INTO, LOCK, LOCK WITH, GET OUT OF, and BOARD).</p>

<p>Openable also defines <strong>lockStatusReportable</strong> to be (!isOpen); for a
fuller explanation see <a href="lockable.html">Lockable</a>. Finally it defines an
<strong>openStatus</strong>() method which returns a sentence like “it’s open” or
“it’s closed” (without punctuation) which can be added to the
description of an object to indicate whether it’s open or closed. The
library defaults are usually fine, but you may, for example, want to
suppress “it’s closed” either for aesthetic reasons or to disguise the
fact that something is openable, in which case you might write something
like:</p>

<p>openStatus { return isOpen ? inherited : ’’; }</p>

<p>If you do that, however, the punctuation will look a bit wayward when
the object is closed, so you also have to tweak the description of the
object from something like:</p>

<p>“It’s red and square. ”</p>

<p>To</p>

<p>“It’s red and square”</p>

<p>And then write your openStatus method thus:</p>

<p> openStatus = (isOpen ? ’ . It\s open’ : ’’)</p>

<p>Note that the final full stop (or period) and space have been removed
from the end of the object description and added instead to the start of
the “It’s open” message.</p>
