<p>The basic properties that apply to almost all Thing objects (and objects
using many of the classes inheriting from Thing) are vocabWords, name,
location, and desc. These are so common the standard <a href="thingtemplate.html">Thing
template</a> allows them to be defined without naming
them, thus:</p>

<p>myObject : Thing ’vocabWords_‘ ’name’ @location<br />
   ”desc”<br />
;</p>

<p>And for the most basic portable objects, this type of definition will
often suffice without the need to define any other properties or
methods. For example, we shall leave a coin for the player to find in
the longCave room (using the <a href="thingtemplate.html">Thing template</a>):</p>

<p>brassCoin : Thing ’(small) brass coin/groat*coins’ ’small brass coin’ @longCave<br />
  ”On the obverse is the head of King Freddie the Fat, and on the reverse<br />
   is stamped ONE GROAT. ”<br />
;</p>

<p>By now, most of these properties should be familiar. The <strong>desc</strong>
(description) property is what is displayed in response to an EXAMINE
command; the only real complication is that you may sometimes want to
define desc as a <em>method</em>, in which case it must be explicitly defined
as a named method outside the template.</p>

<p>The <strong>name</strong> property is the what will normally appear when the object
is listed in the contents of rooms, containers or inventory, or when the
parser needs to refer to the object (E.g. “Which coin do you mean, the
brass coin or the gold coin?”).</p>

<p>For a Thing the <strong>location</strong> is normally the object’s physical
container, which may be a room, an actor (including the Player
Character) who is carrying or wearing the object, or some other form of
physical container (such as a jar or the top surface of a table). The
location can also be specified by using the + notation; e.g. to put the
coin in longCave we could have written</p>

<p>longCave : DarkRoom ’Long Cave’ …<br />
  …<br />
;</p>

<p>+ brassCoin : Thing ’(small) brass coin/groat*coins’ ’small brass coin’ <br />
  ”On the obverse is the head of King Freddie the Fat, and on the reverse<br />
   is stamped ONE GROAT. ”<br />
;</p>

<p>Note that if both the + notation and the @location notation are used on
the same object, the + notation takes precedence. But if the + notation
is used with an explicit setting of the location property, the
explicitly named location property takes precedence. For example, in the
case of the brassCoin with the + notation, if I added @entranceCave to
the object definition after ‘brass coin’ the coin would remain in
longCave, but if I added location=entranceCave the brass coin would
start life in the entranceCave, despite the + property. This can
sometimes be useful if you have a sequence of objects nested within one
another using the + notation and you want to define an object that
doesn’t belong in the containment hierarchy amongst those that do.</p>

<p>Note also that if location is an expression or method, it must be
explicitly defined as a named property outside the template, e.g.
location = (ship.location)</p>

<p>The <a href="vocabwords.html">vocabWords</a> property is perhaps the most complex of
the four, so we shall discuss it in a separate section.</p>
