<p><em>Nothing is hidden except in order to be revealed, nor does anything
become concealed but that it might come into the open</em>. - Mark 4.22</p>

<p>Mark was writing about Jesus’ parables, not Interactive Fiction,
although since according to at least some commentators Mark treats
Jesus’ parables as riddles and according to Nick Montfort (<em>Twisty
Little Passages</em>. Cambridge, MA &amp; London: MIT Press, 2003) the riddle is
one of the precursors of IF, there may be a tenuous link here. It may be
that Mark portrays Jesus’ parables as employing concealment as a
strategy of revelation; it is certainly the case that IF authors often
hide objects in their games with the intention that the player will find
them (hopefully with more success than the disciples in Mark).</p>

<p>There are various ways objects can be hidden and made to appear in
response to a player action. We’ll first explore how this can be done
using Classes and concepts we’ve already met, and show how the library
classes <a href="hidden.html">Hidden</a> and <a href="presentlater.html">PresentLater</a> can
help with the task.</p>
