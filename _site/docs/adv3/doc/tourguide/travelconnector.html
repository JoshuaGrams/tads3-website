<p>TravelConnector is the base class from which all the connectors we have
been looking at ultimately derive. You will probably not define any
objects of the TravelConnector class (as opposed to one of its
subclasses) in your games, since a raw TravelConnector doesn’t actually
lead anywhere. It’s possible that you might define your own subclass of
TravelConnector for some particular purpose, or you could use a
TravelConnector object in your game and override, say, its
actionDobjTravelVia method or its getDestinationMethod to produce the
result you want (though in most cases you’ll probably want to use one of
its subclasses rather than reinventing a wheel that’s already in the
library).</p>

<p>The main importance of TravelConnector, however, is that it defines a
large number of the properties and methods used on all its subclasses.
These are listed below for the sake of reference, using descriptions
taken from the comments in the library code:</p>

<p><em>Properties:</em><br />
<strong>connectorStagingLocation:</strong> The “staging location” for travel through
this connector. By default, if we have a location, that’s our staging
location; if we don’t have a location (in which case we probably an
outermost room), we don’t have a staging location.</p>

<p><strong>isCircularPassage:</strong> Is this a “circular” passage? A circular passage
is one that explicitly connects back to its origin, so that traveling
through the connector leaves us where we started. When a passage is
marked as circular, we’ll describe travel through the passage exactly as
though we had actually gone somewhere. By default, if traveling through
a passage leaves us where we started, we assume that nothing happened,
so we don’t describe any travel.<br />
Circular passages don’t often occur in ordinary settings; these are
mostly useful in disorienting environments, such as twisty cave
networks, where a passage between locations can change direction and
even loop back on itself.</p>

<p><strong>isConnectorListed:</strong> Is this connector listed? This indicates whether
or not the exit is allowed to be displayed in lists of exits, such as in
the status line or in “you can’t go that way” messages. By default, all
exits are allowed to appear in listings.<br />
Note that this indicates if listing is ALLOWED - it doesn’t guarantee
that listing actually occurs. A connector can be listed only if this is
true, AND the point-of-view actor for the listing can perceive the exit
(which means that isConnectorApparent must return true, and there must
be sufficient light to see the exit).</p>

<p><strong>travelBarrier:</strong> Barrier or barriers to travel. This property can be
set to a single <a href="travelbarrier.html">TravelBarrier</a> object or to a list
of TravelBarrier objects. checkTravelBarriers() checks each barrier
specified here.</p>

<p><strong>travelMemory:</strong> Our “travel memory” table. If this contains a non-nil
lookup table object, we’ll store a record of each successful traversal
of a travel connector here - we’ll record the destination keyed by the
combination of actor, origin, and connector, so that we can later check
to see if the actor has any memory of where a given connector goes from
a given origin. * We keep this information by default, which is why we
statically create the table here. Keeping this information does involve
some overhead, so some authors might want to get rid of this table (by
setting the property to nil) if the game doesn’t make any use of the
information. Note that this table is stored just once, in the
TravelConnector class itself - there’s not a separate table per
connector.</p>

<p><em>Methods:</em><br />
<strong>actorTravelPreCond (actor):</strong> Get the travel preconditions that this
connector requires for travel by the given actor. In most cases, this
won’t depend on the actor, but it’s provided as a parameter anyway; in
most cases, this will just apply the conditions that are relevant to
actors as travelers.<br />
By default, we require actors to be “travel ready” before traversing a
connector. The exact meaning of “travel ready” is provided by the
actor’s immediate location, but it usually simply means that the actor
is standing. This ensures that the actor isn’t sitting in a chair or
lying down or something like that. Some connectors might not require
this, so this routine can be overridden per connector.<br />
Note that this will only be called when an actor is the traveler. When a
vehicle or other kind of traveler is doing the travel, this will not be
invoked.</p>

<p><strong>canTravelerPass (traveler):</strong> Check to see if the Traveler object is
allowed to travel through this connector. Returns true if travel is
allowed, nil if not.<br />
This is called from checkTravelBarriers() to check any conditions coded
directly into the TravelConnector. By default, we simply return true;
subclasses can override this to apply special conditions.<br />
If an override wants to disallow travel, it should return nil here, and
then provide an override for explainTravelBarrier() to provide a
descriptive message explaining why the travel isn’t allowed.<br />
Conditions here serve essentially the same purpose as barrier
conditions. The purpose of providing this additional place for the same
type of conditions is simply to improve the convenience of defining
travel conditions for cases where barriers are unnecessary. The main
benefit of using a barrier is that the same barrier object can be
re-used with multiple connectors, so if the same set of travel
conditions apply to several different connectors, barriers allow the
logic to be defined once in a single barrier object and then re-used
easily in each place it’s needed. However, when a particular condition
is needed in only one place, creating a barrier to represent the
condition is a bit verbose; in such cases, the condition can be placed
in this method more conveniently.</p>

<p><strong>checkTravelBarriers (dest):</strong> Check barriers. The TravelVia check()
routine must call this to enforce barriers.</p>

<p><strong>connectorBack (traveler, dest):</strong> Find a connector in the destination
location that connects back as the source of travel from the given
connector when traversed from the source location. Returns nil if there
is no such connector. This must be called while the traveler is still in
the source location; we’ll attempt to find the connector back to the
traveler’s current location.<br />
The purpose of this routine is to identify the connector by which the
traveler arrives in the new location. This can be used, for example, to
generate a connector-specific message describing the traveler’s
emergence from the connector (so we can say one thing if the traveler
arrives via a door, and another if the traveler arrives by climbing up a
ladder).<br />
By default, we’ll try to find a travel link in the destination that
links us back to this same connector, in which case we’ll return ‘self’
as the connector from which the traveler emerges in the new location.
Failing that, we’ll look for a travel link whose apparent source is the
origin location. This should be overridden for any connector with an
explicit complementary connector. For example, it is common to implement
a door using a pair of objects, one representing each side of the door;
in such cases, each door object would simply return its twin here. Note
that a complementary connector doesn’t actually have to go anywhere,
since it’s still useful to have a connector back simply for describing
travelers arriving on the connector.<br />
This <em>must</em> be overridden when the destination location doesn’t have a
simple connector whose apparent source is this connector, because in
such cases we won’t be able to find the reverse connector with our
direction search.</p>

<p><strong>connectorGetConnectorTo (origin, traveler, dest):</strong> Get the travel
connector leading to the given destination from the given origin and for
the given travel. Return nil if we don’t know a connector leading
there.<br />
By default, we simply return ‘self’ if our destination is the given
destination, or nil if not.<br />
Some subclasses might encapsulate one or more “secondary” connectors -
that is, the main connector might choose among multiple other
connectors. In these cases, the secondary connectors typically won’t be
linked to directions on their own, so the room can’t see them directly -
it can only find them through us, since we’re effectively a wrapper for
the secondary connectors. In these cases, we won’t have any single
destination ourself, so getDestination() will have to return nil. But we
<em>can</em> work backwards: given a destination, we can find the secondary
connector that points to that destination. That’s what this routine is
for.</p>

<p><strong>connectorTravelPreCond ( ):</strong> Get any connector-specific
pre-conditions for travel via this connector.</p>

<p><strong>createUnlistedProxy ( ) :</strong> Get an unlisted proxy for this connector.
This is normally called from the asExit() macro to set up one room exit
direction as an unlisted synonym for another.</p>

<p><strong>darkTravel (actor, dest):</strong> Handle travel in the dark. Specifically,
this is called when an actor attempts travel from one dark location to
another dark location. (We don’t invoke this in any other case:
light-to-light, light-to-dark, and dark-to-light travel are all allowed
without any special checks.)<br />
By default, we will prohibit dark-to-dark travel by calling the
location’s darkTravel handler. Individual connectors can override this
to allow such travel or apply different handling.</p>

<p><strong>describeArrival (traveler, origin, dest):</strong> Describe an actor’s
arrival through the connector from the given origin into the given
destination. This description is from the point of view of another actor
in the destination.<br />
Note that this is called on the connector that reverses the travel, NOT
on the connector the actor is actually traversing - that is, ‘self’ is
the backwards connector, leading from the destination back to the origin
location. So, if we have two sides to a door, and the actor traverses
the first side, this will be called on the second side - the one that
links the destination back to the origin.</p>

<p><strong>describeDeparture (traveler, origin, dest)</strong>: Describe an actor’s
departure through the connector from the given origin to the given
destination. This description is from the point of view of another actor
in the origin location.</p>

<p><strong>describeLocalArrival (traveler, origin, dest)</strong>: Describe a “local
arrival” via this connector. This is called when the traveler moves
around entirely within the field of view of the player character - that
is, the traveler’s origin is visible to the player character when we
arrive in our destination. We’ll describe the travel not in terms of
arriving, since the traveler was already here to start with, but rather
as entering the destination.</p>

<p><strong>dobjFor (TravelVia):</strong> Action handler for the internal “TravelVia”
action. This is not a real action, but is instead a pseudo-action that
we implement generically for travel via the connector. Subclasses that
want to handle real actions by traveling via the connector can use
remapTo(TravelVia) to implement the real action handlers. Note that
remapTo should be used (rather than, say, asDobjFor), since this will
ensure that every type of travel through the connector actually looks
like a TravelVia action, which is useful for intercepting travel actions
generically in other code.</p>

<p><strong>explainTravelBarrier (traveler):</strong> Explain why canTravelerPass()
returned nil. This is called to display an explanation of why travel is
not allowed by self.canTravelerPass().<br />
Since the default canTravelerPass() always allows travel, the default
implementation of this method does nothing. Whenever canTravelerPass()
is overridden to return nil, this should also be overridden to provide
an appropriate explanation.</p>

<p><strong>fixedSource (dest, traveler)</strong> Get the “fixed” source for travelers
emerging from this connector, if possible. This can return nil if the
connector does not have a fixed relationship with another connector.<br />
The purpose of this routine is to find complementary connectors for
simple static map connections. This is especially useful for direct
room-to-room connections.<br />
When a connector relationship other than a simple static mapping exists,
the connectors must generally override connectorBack(), in which case
this routine will not be needed (at least, this routine won’t be needed
as long as the overridden connectorBack() doesn’t call it). Whenever it
is not clear how to implement this routine, don’t - implement
connectorBack() instead.</p>

<p><strong>getApparentDestination (origin, actor)</strong>: Get the apparent destination
of travel by the actor to the given origin. This returns the location to
which the connector travels, AS FAR AS THE ACTOR KNOWS. If the actor
does not know and cannot tell where the connector leads, this should
return nil.<br />
Note that this method does NOT necessarily return the actual
destination, because we obviously can’t know the destination for certain
until we traverse the connection. Rather, the point of this routine is
to return as much information as the actor is supposed to have. This can
be used for purposes like auto-mapping, where we’d want to show what the
player character knows of the map, and NPC goal-seeking, where an NPC
tries to figure out how to get from one point to another based on the
NPC’s knowledge of the map. In these sorts of applications, it’s
important to use only knowledge that the actor is supposed to have
within the parameters of the simulation.<br />
Callers should always test isConnectorApparent() before calling this
routine. This routine does not check to ensure that the connector is
apparent, so it could return misleading information if used
independently of isConnectorApparent(); for example, if the connector
<em>formerly</em> worked but has now disappeared, and the actor has a memory of
the former destination, we’ll return the remembered destination.<br />
The actor can know the destination by a number of means:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The location is familiar to the character. For example, if the
setting is the character’s own house, the character would obviously know
the house well, so would know where you’d end up going east from the
living room or south from the kitchen. We use the origin method
actorKnowsDestination() to determine this.</li>
  <li>The destination is readily visible from the origin location, or is
clearly marked. For example, in an outdoor setting, it might be clear
that going east from the field takes you to the hilltop. In an indoor
setting, an open passage might make it clear that going east from the
living room takes you to the dining room. We use the origin method
actorKnowsDestination() to determine this.</li>
  <li>The actor has been through the connector already in the course of the
game, and so remembers the connection by virtue of recent experience. If
our travelMemory class property is set to a non-nil lookup table object,
then we’ll automatically use the lookup table to remember the
destination each time an actor travels via a connector, and use this
information by default to provide apparent destination information.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>getDestination (origin, traveler):</strong> Get our destination, given the
traveler and the origin location.<br />
This method is required to return the current destination for the
travel. If the connector doesn’t go anywhere, this should return nil.
The results of this method must be stable for the extent of a turn, up
until the time travel actually occurs; in other words, it must be
possible to call this routine simply for information purposes, to
determine where the travel will end up.<br />
This method should not trigger any side effects, since it’s necessary to
be able to call this method more than once in the course of a given
travel command. If it’s necessary to trigger side effects when the
connector is actually traversed, apply the side effects in
noteTraversal().<br />
For auto-mapping and the like, note that getApparentDestination() is a
better choice, since this method has internal information that might not
be apparent to the characters in the game and thus shouldn’t be revealed
through something like an auto-map. This method is intended for internal
use in the course of processing a travel action, since it knows the true
destination of the travel.<br />
<em>Note that on the TravelConnector class this method simply returns nil,
which is why a raw TravelConnector won’t get you anywhere. This method
is overridden on subclasses to do something more useful.</em></p>

<p><strong>isConnectorApparent (origin, actor):</strong> Determine if the travel
connection is apparent - as a travel connector - to the actor in the
given origin location. This doesn’t indicate whether or not travel is
possible, or where travel goes, or that the actor can tell where the
passage goes; this merely indicates whether or not the actor should
realize that the passage exists at all.<br />
A closed door, for example, would return true, because even a closed
door makes it clear that travel is possible in the direction, even if
it’s not possible currently. A secret door, on the other hand, would
return nil while closed, because it would not be apparent to the actor
that the object is a door at all.</p>

<p><strong>isConnectorPassable (origin, traveler):</strong> Determine if the travel
connection is passable by the given traveler in the current state. For
example, a door would return true when open, nil when closed.<br />
This information is intended to help game code probing the structure of
the map. This information is NOT used in actor travel; for actor travel,
we rely on custom checks in the connector’s TravelVia handler to enforce
the conditions of travel. Actor travel uses TravelVia customizations
rather than this method because that allows better specificity in
reporting failures. This method lets game code get at the same
information, but in a more coarse-grained fashion.</p>

<p><strong>isConnectorVisibleInDark (origin, actor)</strong>: Can the given actor see
this connector in the dark, looking from the given origin? Returns true
if so, nil if not.<br />
This is used to determine if the actor can travel from the given origin
via this connector when the actor (in the origin location) is in
darkness.<br />
By default, we implement the usual convention, which is that travel from
a dark room is possible only when the destination is lit. If we can’t
determine our destination, we will assume that the connector is not
visible.</p>

<p><strong>noteTraversal (traveler):</strong> Note that the connector is being
traversed. This is invoked just before the traveler is moved; this
notification is fired after the other travel-related notifications
(beforeTravel, actorTravel, travelerLeaving). This is a good place to
display any special messages describing what happens during the travel,
because any messages displayed here will come after any messages related
to reactions from other objects. (By default this method does nothing,
and can be freely overridden with your own code; note, however, that it
is overridden by the library in TravelWithMessage, and hence in the
subclasses of <a href="travelwithmessage.html">TravelWithMessage</a>, such as
<a href="travelmessage.html">TravelMessage</a>,
<a href="notravelmessage.html">NoTravelMessage</a>, and
<a href="fakeconnector.html">FakeConnector</a>, as well).</p>

<p><strong>rememberTravel (origin, actor, dest):</strong> Service routine: add a memory
of a successful traversal of a travel connector. If we have a travel
memory table, we’ll add the traversal to the table, so that we can find
it later.<br />
This is called from Traveler.travelerTravelTo() on successful travel.
We’re called for each actor participating in the travel.</p>
