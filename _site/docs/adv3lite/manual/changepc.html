# Changing the Player Character

Many, perhaps most, works of Interactive Fiction stick to the same
player character throughout. There are some games, however, in which the
player character changes to another character during the course of the
game, perhaps more than once, or perhaps swapping between two or more
characters.

If the various characters never met, that is, none of the player
characters never functioned as an NPC and were never in scope while the
player was playing as another character, then changing from one player
character to another would be almost as simple as setting
**gPlayerChar** to the new player character and letting the player know
what had happened. Where, however, the same Actor object may function as
the player character at one point in the game and an NPC at another
point, it becomes more complicated.

In this case we need to call **setPlayer(actor)**, where *actor* is the
Actor object we want to become the new player character. This will
become the actor from whose perspective the game is played from then
one, and the one referred to by the parser as 'you'. If we want our new
player character to be referred to in the first or third person, we have
to supply setPlayer() with a second parameter, 1 or 3 respectively, for
example <span class="code">setPlayer(bob, 1)</span> to make bob the new
player character referred to as 'I' or 'me'.

If we do this we probably also want to let the player know what's just
happened. To assist with this setPlayer() returns the previous name of
the new player character, so when the player becomes Bob you could use
code like this:

<div class="code">

     "You are now &lt;&lt;setPlayer(bob)&gt;&gt;. ";
     bob.getOutermostRoom.lookAroundWithin(); 
     

</div>

Something else you can do to help players keep track of who they're now
meant to be is to include the name of the player character in the status
line. One way to do that might be to include it in parentheses after the
room name, which we can do like this:

<div class="code">

     modify Room
        statusName(actor)
        {
            inherited(actor);
            if(libGlobal.playerCharName != nil)
                " (as &lt;<libGlobal.playerCharName>&gt;) ";
        }
    ;
     

&lt;/div&gt;

Or, alternatively, if we prefer it:

<div class="code">

     
    modify statusLine
        showStatusLeft()
        {
            inherited;
            if(libGlobal.playerCharName != nil)
                " [as &lt;<libGlobal.playerCharName>&gt;] ";
        }
    ; 

&lt;/div&gt;

Or again, if we didn't want the score and turn count at the right hand
end of the status line we could do this:

<div class="code">

    modify statusLine
        showStatusRight()
        {        
            if(libGlobal.playerCharName != nil)
                " [as &lt;<libGlobal.playerCharName>&gt;] ";
        }
    ;

&lt;/div&gt;

You can use whichever of these you prefer, or devise your own variant.

<span id="pcname"></span>

Note the use of <span class="code">libGlobal.**playerCharName**</span>
here. This is set by <span class="code">setPlayer()</span>, so that if
we've never called <span class="code">setPlayer()</span> it will be nil
(unless, of course, we set it ourselves, which we might want to do at
the start of the game). We need it because we can't just use
<span class="code">gPlayerChar.theName</span> to get at the player
characters's name, since unless it's a third-person player character
that would just be 'I' or 'you' (which is not very informative).

Another thing to bear in mind is that if the same object is going to act
as the player character at one time and an NPC at another, it should be
defined as being of class Actor; the player character can be of class
Thing, but this wouldn't be appropriate for an NPC. Again, when you're
defining an actual or potential player character who might also become
an NPC at some point, you should define it more or less as if it was an
NPC, except for the <span class="code">person</span> property which may
be 1 or 2 if this is the Actor that's starting out as the player
character; for example:

<div class="code">

     
    + joan: Actor 'Joan; large; woman; her'
        "She's quite a large woman. "
        
        person =  2
    ;

</div>

<span id="ispc"></span>

One more point: the description you want in response to X ME when Joan
is the player character will probably be a bit different from the
description you want in response to X ME when Joan is an NPC. You can
test for which is applicable using the **isPlayerChar** property of the
Actor and write the desc property accordingly. A minimally varying one
might look like this:

<div class="code">

     
    + joan: Actor 'Joan; large; woman; her'
        "&lt;<if isPlayerChar="">&gt;You're&lt;<else>&gt;She's&lt;<end>&gt; quite a large woman. "
        
        person =  2
    ;

&lt;/div&gt;

In practice, you'd probably want to vary the two descriptions by more
than this.

&lt;/div&gt;
