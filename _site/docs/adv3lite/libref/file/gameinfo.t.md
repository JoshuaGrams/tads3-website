This is an add-in utility for tads 3 games to make it simpler to add
game information to a compiled game.

The game information mechanism lets you bind certain documentary
information about the game directly into the compiled (.t3) file. The
information can then be extracted by automated tools; for example,
archive maintainers can extract the game information and use it to
describe the archive entry.
