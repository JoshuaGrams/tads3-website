# Command Help

## Overview

When the player enters an empty command (by hitting the enter key at the
command prompt without typing anything), the main library responds
either by carrying out a LOOK command or by complaining that the command
is empty (depending on the setting of
<span class="code">Parser.autoLook</span>). This extension changes that
behaviour so that the player is instead offered a brief menu of options
(provided the new Parser property **autoHelp** is true, as it is by
default in this extension). Selecting one of these options will then
cause this extension to display a list of actions in the chosen category
that the player could try; on an HTML-enabled interpreter these will be
hyperlinked so that the player can just click on one of them to execute
it.

  
<span id="classes"></span>

## New Action and Properties

In addition to a number of properties/methods intended purely for
internal use, this extension defines the following new Action object and
properties:

- *New Action*: <span class="code">CmdMenu</span>
- *Properties of CmdMenu*:
  <span class="code">manipulationActions</span>,
  <span class="code">excludeCheckFailures</span>,
  <span class="code">maxObjs</span>.
- *Additional/overridden properties/methods of Parser*:
  <span class="code">emptyCommand()</span>,
  <span class="code">autoHelp</span>.

  
<span id="usage"></span>

## Usage

Include the cmdhelp.t file after the library files but before your game
source files.

If the player then enters an empty command, the response will be:

<div class="cmdline">

    What would you like to do?
    1. Go to another location
    2. Investigate your surroundings
    3. Relocate something
    4. Manipulate something
    5. Talk to someone

</div>

Note that Option 5 will only be displayed if there is in fact someone
available for the player character to talk to.

The player can then respond by selecting one of the numbers above
(either typing on it or clicking on it). The extension will then respond
by displaying some suggested commands. For example, if the player
selected option 2 above then the game might respond:

<div class="cmdline">

    Here are some suggestions (other actions may also be possible):
    look  listen smell  inventory

    examine box   examine cheese   examine door a   examine ground   examine iron key   examine Lucy   examine note   examine pen   examine table   examine you   

    read note   

    look in box 

    smell cheese   

</div>

If the game is being played on an HTML-capable interpreter the player
can then click on one of the suggested commands to execute it.

<span id="exclude"></span>

Note that, as far as possible, the extension tries to offer the player
only commands that are likely to work, i.e. commands involving only
objects that are available to the player and on which the suggested
command is likely to succeed. This test generally involves trying the
verify stage — or some equivalent checks — of the relevant action on
various objects to see which would allow the action to go ahead. If the
CmdMenu property **excludeCheckFailures** is true (as it is by default)
then the relevant check routines are also tried to see if they would
rule out the action. Note, however, that any preconditions that may
apply can't be checked in this way, since this might trigger implicit
actions. Note also, however, that any side-effects of a check() method,
such as setting a flag to show that it has been tried, *will* be carried
out.

If there are quite a large number of objects in scope, there is a risk
that player could be overwhelmed by the volume of suggestions. The
number of suggestions is therefore limited by the **maxObjs** property
of <span class="code">CmdMenu</span> (which has a value of 10 by
default). This limits the number of objects (or pairs of objects) that
will be suggested in connection with any one action. You can adjust this
number up or down if you feel that players are getting too few or too
many suggestions. In the case of the more common actions the extension
tries to prioritize objects that haven't been interacted with as
recently as others, which should help other objects enter the list of
suggestions once some actions have been carried out.

With the exception of LockWith and UnlockWith, the actions that are
suggested in the "Manipulate something" section are those listed in the
**manipulationActions** property of <span class="code">CmdMenu</span>.
The actions listed in this property must all be TActions (i.e. actions
that take a direct object only, which direct object must be a Thing).
This allows you to change the actions that might be suggested, and also
to add any TActions you define in your own game. The actions listed in
the <span class="code">manipulationActions</span> list are suggested
only on objects for which they would pass the verify stage and, if
<span class="code">excludeCheckFailures</span>, the check stage. In
practice this is likely to limit the actions suggested to a manageable
number.

This restriction to TActions is not quite so limiting as it may first
appear, since many TIActions have TAction equivalents that then prompt
for the indirect object. For example the library defines the following
on the Thing class:

<div class="code">

        isDiggable = nil

        dobjFor(Dig)
        {
            preCond = [touchObj]
            verify() 
            {
                if(!isDiggable)
                   illogical(cannotDigMsg); 
            }
            
            /* 
             *   If digging is allowed, then most likely we need an implement like a
             *   spade to dig with, so our default action is to ask for one. This
             *   can be overridden on objects in which the actors can effectively
             *   dig with their bare hands.
             */
            action() { askForIobj(DigWith); }
        } 

</div>

This means that if you defined an object, the beach, say, as being
diggable (<span class="code">isDiggable = true</span>) and the player
subsequently tried the DIG BEACH suggestion, he or she would then be
prompted "What do you want to dig with?" (or, if there was just one
digging implement in scope, the parser would select it automatically).
Many of the library actions are defined in accordance with this pattern,
and if you follow it when defining your own TIActions then this
extension should be able to cope with them reasonably well if you just
add the matching TAction to the
<span class="code">manipulationActions</span> list.

Finally, note that if the player selects option 5 and talks to an NPC,
the default behaviour of this extension is to hyperlink any topic
suggestions so that they, too, can be selected by clicking on them.

  
<span id="limitations"></span>

## Limitations and Explanations

This extension does not replace the command line interface with a
point-and-click one, even though it moves some way in that direction. In
a large work of IF there may be too many combinations of objects and
actions for a point-and-click interface to be practicable, and in any
case offering a choice of every combination of actions and objects that
might work could potentially lead to spoilers. Moreover, actions that
involve topics and literals can hardly be reduced to a point-and-click
interface, since the set of allowable actions may be infinite (although
the hyperlinking of suggested topics of conversation is a small step in
the direction of providing a partial point-and-click interface for
conversation).

In any case, this extension does not replace the command line interface
at all. The command prompt remains available for the player to use at
any time. Moreover, when a player clicks on a suggested command s/he can
see the command being entered at the command prompt just before it is
executed. At least in theory, this could help educate players in the use
of the command line by providing examples of commands that work. This
extension should thus be seen more as a way of easing players into the
command-line interface than as a way of replacing it. While it may be
possible to devise a game that can be played through to a successful
conclusion by clicking on the commands suggested by this extension, in
most cases players will probably have to type at least some commands on
their own.

  

This covers most of what you need to know to use this extension. For
additional information see the source code and comments in the
[cmdhelp.t](../cmdhelp.t) file.
