# Is the bird in the nest?

Despite all we have done so far in this chapter, the game still has one
rather obvious flaw: the intention is that the game should be won when
Heidi restores both bird and nest to the branch with the bird in the
nest, but if you try it as it is you'll see that all she has to do to
win the game is to put the nest on the branch; as things stands she can
ignore the poor little bird altogether!

Fortunately this is very easy to fix. All we need to do is to check that
the nest is on the branch *and* that the bird is in the nest:

<div class="code">

    + branch: Thing 'wide firm bough; flat; branch'
        "It's flat enough to support a small object. "
        
        iFixed = true
        isListed = true
        contType = On
        
        afterAction()
        {
            if(nest.isIn(self) &amp;&amp; bird.isIn(nest))
                finishGameMsg(ftVictory, [finishOptionUndo]);
        }
    ;

</div>

We use the <span class="code">isIn()</span> method here to test for
containment: <span class="code">obj1.isIn(obj2)</span> is true if obj1
is either directly or indirectly contained in obj2. If you want to test
for direct containment you could use
<span class="code">isDirectlyIn()</span>, and that would have worked
here, but it isn't actually needed.

Perhaps of more significance is the use of <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>
to join two conditions. The <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> operator is the
TADS 3 way of joining two expressions together with a logical *and*. The
compound expression <span class="code">expression1 &amp;&amp; expression2</span>
is true if and only if *expression1* and *expression2* are both true,
otherwise it is nil (i.e. false). Note that either or both of
*expression1* and *expression2* can themselves be compound expressions,
but if they are, it is normally as well to surround them with
parentheses to make your meaning clear both to the compiler and
yourself.

Remember that TADS 3 considers a value of 0 or nil to be false and
anything else to be true. The value of the expression
<span class="code">2 &amp;&amp; 4 </span>is therefore true, while the value of
the expression <span class="code">bird &amp;&amp; nil</span> is nil.

TADS 3 also defines a logical or operator, which looks like this:
<span class="code">\|\|</span>. The compound expression
<span class="code">expression1 \|\| expression2</span> is true if either
*expression1* or *expression2* is true (i.e. neither nil nor 0) and nil
if both *expression1* and *expression2* are false (i.e. either nil or
0).

TADS 3's third logical operator is the logical not, represented by an
exclamation mark, <span class="code">!</span>. If
<span class="code">expression</span> is true then
<span class="code">!expression</span> is nil; if
<span class="code">expression</span> is nil then
<span class="code">!expression</span> is true.

For example:

<div class="code">

    local a = 12, b = 6;
    (a == b * 2) || (b == 7) // true, because a is twice b
    (a == b * 2) &amp;&amp; (b == 7) // nil, because b is not 7
    (bird || nest) // true because bird is not nil
    'Hampster' &amp;&amp; 'forest' // true because neither string is nil
    (a &gt; b) &amp;&amp;  !bird.ofKind(Thing) // nil because bird does inherit from Thing

</div>

Finally note that both <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> and
<span class="code">\|\|</span> are *short-circuit operators*. This means
that in the expression <span class="code">a &amp;&amp; b</span>,
<span class="code">b</span> is never even evaluated if
<span class="code">a</span> is nil (or 0) since unless
<span class="code">a</span> is true, the compound expression
<span class="code">a &amp;&amp; b</span> must be false. Conversely in the
expression <span class="code">a \|\| b</span>,
<span class="code">b</span> will never be evaluated if
<span class="code">a</span> turns out to be true, since if
<span class="code">a</span> is true then the entire compound expression
<span class="code">a \|\| b</span> must be true. That is why the
<span class="code">bird \|\| nest</span> example above was true simply
because <span class="code">bird</span> was neither nil nor 0; given that
<span class="code">bird</span> is not false, the entire expression must
be true, regardless of the value of <span class="code">nest</span>.

Besides saving time, this short-circuit evaluation makes it safe to
write code like the following, even when <span class="code">obj</span>
might sometimes be nil:

<div class="code">

    if(obj &amp;&amp; obj.bulk &gt; 4)
       say "It's quite a bulky object. ";

</div>

In this example, if <span class="code">obj</span> is nil, the expression
<span class="code">(obj.bulk \&gt; 4)</span> is never evaluated; we thus
avoid the run-time error that would otherwise result from trying to
evaluate a property of nil.

Now try compiling and running the game one last time to check that
everything still behaves as you expect.
