## Introduction

**<a href="https://www.tads.org" target="_blank">TADS 3</a>** is a free
authoring system for writing your own interactive fiction (IF).

Quite often when writing TADS 3 games, inspiration strikes—and then
halts and cools while searching the documentation for the right class or
property. This resource is to help you find what you already know, and
to help you discover what you may not.

This periplus organizes the adv3 library by topics and subject matter.
Its goal is to make it easier to locate information on particular
subjects when crafting a TADS 3 game.

**This is neither a complete adv3 class reference nor a TADS 3
programmer's guide.** The links under "See Also" will transport you to
complete language and library documentation.

*(If you're seeking the adv3Lite periplus,
<a href="../adv3Lite/adv3liteindex.html" target="_blank">go here</a>.)*

## Organizing principles

- **Reorganize existing documentation:** None of the information
  presented here is new (or written by me). Rather, this periplus
  reorganizes existing material in a novel way.
- **Strive for clarity, not completeness:** Even a casual comparison
  between this reference's class list and the complete class library
  will reveal the periplus' incompleteness. This is by design: Rather
  than link to *every* class in the library (many of which are internal
  the library itself), the periplus selects classes most useful for
  writing games.
- **Taxonomy, not hierarchy:** Keen observers will notice some classes
  are listed twice, and that the class hierarchy is not preserved in the
  index structure. Again, this is by design: When a class falls into
  multiple categories, it's listed where appropriate. Object hierarchy
  and inheritance should be gleaned from the technical reference pages,
  not from the periplus' organization.
