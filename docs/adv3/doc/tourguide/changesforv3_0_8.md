The ShipboardRoom class renamed [Shipboard](shipboardroom.html).  
  
The custom TardisRoom class is no longer used in the sample game, since
it is identical to the new [ShipboardRoom](lockablewithkey.html).  
  
Added a slightly fuller explanation (or rather, warning against abuse
of) the locationList property of [MultiLoc](multiloc.html).  
  
Added to the explanation of [roomParts](roomparts.html), specifically in
relation to changing or moving them dynamically during the course of a
game.  
  
Added an explanation of the new specialTopicHistory object to the
description of [SpecialTopic](specialtopic.html).  
  
Changed the [gameMain](startupcodegamemain.html) definition to use the
new setAboutBox() method.  
  
Added a brief explanation of the new [gameMain](startupcodegamemain.html)
property allVerbsAllowAll.  
  
Amended the final couple of paragraphs in the description of
[ComplexContainer](complexcontainer.html) to take account of new features
(specifically the remapping of isOpen, isLocked, makeOpen and makeLocked
to the subContainer).  
  
Amended the definition of the custom [RedCandle](candle.html) class to
fix an obscure bug in the sample game.  
  
Added a new section on [Occluder](occluder.html).  
  
Corrected a number of typos.
