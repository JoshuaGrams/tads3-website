So far we have to rely on the MEGA or FIAT LUX cheating (I mean
debugging, of course) command in order to explore dark locations. The
time has come to do the job properly by providing the player with light
sources. These can be as simple as an object that permanently glows, or
as relatively complex as candles, torches/flashlights or oil lamps,
together with matches to light them.
