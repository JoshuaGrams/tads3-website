# Part V: The System Library

The TADS 3 compiler includes a small run-time library that provides
basic system services that most programs will need. This library is
linked into your program by default. This section describes the services
that the system library provides.

Note that the system library isn't the same as adv3, which is the
standard adventure game library. Adv3 is a large library that defines a
comprehensive framework for text-based Interactive Fiction; in contrast,
the system library is small and provides only generic
application-program services. Games written using adv3 *also*
incorporate the system library, so the information here will be of
interest to most TADS 3 programmers, whether using adv3 or not.
