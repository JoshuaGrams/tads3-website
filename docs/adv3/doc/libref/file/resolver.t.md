TADS 3 Library: Resolvers.

This module defines the Resolver classes. A Resolver is an abstract
object that the parser uses to control the resolution of noun phrases to
game objects. Specialized Resolver subclasses allow noun phrases to be
resolved differently according to their grammatical function in a
command.
