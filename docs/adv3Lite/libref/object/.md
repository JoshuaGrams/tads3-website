SeekAction is designed to handle of commands FIND X, LOOK FOR Y or
SEARCH FOR Z, when they don't seem to be intended as attempts to look
something up in a Consultable. We make it a TopicAction so that it will
match whatever the player types, and so not give away any premature
spoilery information by the nature of the parser's response.

The appropriate response then depends on the player character's state of
knowledge. In the most general case the player is simply given
instructions on how to go about looking for things. This hardly seems
appropriate, however if the object requested is in plain sight, in which
case we point this out to the player. As a courtesy to the player, we
also remind him or her of where an object was last seen, if it has been
seen.

One or two complications need to be dealt with. If the player finds
something like FIND SMELL or FIND NOISE then we should describe it as
having been smelt or heard elsewhere, not seen. We also want to make
sure that the command never matches an Unthing in preference to a Thing,
and that if an Unthing is matched it is not described as being present.
