::: fdesc
Many of the ideas in this file are based on Emily Short\'s
NewbieGrammar.h extension for Inform 6, itself based on observation of
some of the non-standard things newcomers to IF tend to type. The idea
is to get the parser to recognize these commands, at least to the extent
of giving the player who issues them some help towards typing more
useful commands rather than giving a standard (and probably unhelpful)
parser error message

We also provide some helpful brief IF playing instructions for newbies,
a sample transcript they can view to get the general idea, and a
mechanism to check whether someone is entering an excessive number of
invalid commands (so that we can then offer more help).
