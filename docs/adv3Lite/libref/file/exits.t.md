TADS 3 Library - Exits Lister

This module provides an automatic exit lister that shows the apparent
exits from the player character's location. The automatic exit lister
can optionally provide these main features:

\- An "exits" verb lets the player explicitly show the list of apparent
exits, along with the name of the room to which each exit connects.

\- Exits can be shown automatically as part of the room description.
This extra information can be controlled by the player through the
"exits on" and "exits off" command.

\- Exits can be shown automatically when an actor tries to go in a
direction where no exit exists, as a helpful reminder of which
directions are valid.
