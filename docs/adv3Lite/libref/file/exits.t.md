TADS 3 Library - Exits Lister

This module provides an automatic exit lister that shows the apparent
exits from the player character\'s location. The automatic exit lister
can optionally provide these main features:

\- An \"exits\" verb lets the player explicitly show the list of
apparent exits, along with the name of the room to which each exit
connects.

\- Exits can be shown automatically as part of the room description.
This extra information can be controlled by the player through the
\"exits on\" and \"exits off\" command.

\- Exits can be shown automatically when an actor tries to go in a
direction where no exit exists, as a helpful reminder of which
directions are valid.
