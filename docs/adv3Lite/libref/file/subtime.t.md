SUBTIME EXTENSION

Adapted for use with adv3Lite by Eric Eve; the changes include using the
Date class rather than the custom format for storing dates and times
used in MJR's original version.

"Subjective Time" module. This implements a form of in-game time-keeping
that attempts to mimic the player's subjective experience of time
passing in the scenario while still allowing for occasional, reasonably
precise time readings, such as from a wristwatch in the game world.
