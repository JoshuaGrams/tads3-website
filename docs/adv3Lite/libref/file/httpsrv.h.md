This module defines the HTTPServer intrinsic class. This class is used
to set up a network HTTP server, which has a number of potential
applications:

\- Run a game in a client/server configuration, so that the user
interface is running in a Web browser on one machine, and the game
itself is running on a separate server machine on the network. This lets
the game run on handheld devices that might be too slow to run the game
directly, allows running the game without any software installation, and
makes the game more portable by depending only on a browser being
available rather than requiring a TADS interpreter.

\- Run a game in with a browser-based UI, so that it can take advantage
of HTML DOM and Javascript. Modern browsers are more powerful than HTML
TADS, so it\'s possible to create a more elaborate and customized game
UI by running in a browser.

\- Create a multi-user game, by running the game on a server and writing
the game to accept connections from more than one player.
