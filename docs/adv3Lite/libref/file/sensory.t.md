sensory.t

The SENSORY EXTENSION is intended for use with the adv3Lite library. It
adds slightly more sophisticated handling for smells and sounds, as well
as a new SensoryEvent class which can be useful for making actors and
other objects respond to sensory events.

VERSION 2  
19-Jul-14

Usage: include this extension after the adv3Lite library but before your
own game-specific files. Make sure that events.t is also included in
your build.
