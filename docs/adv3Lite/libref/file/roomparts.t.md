roomparts.t

The ROOMPARTS extension is intended for use with the adv3Lite library.
It adds walls and a ceiling to every Room. It also adds an OutdoorRoom
class that has only ground and sky. It also allows Things to be
associated with particular room parts, such as a picture hanging on a
wall.

VERSION 1\
20-Jul-13

Usage: include this extension after the adv3Lite library but before your
own game-specific files. This will add four walls and a ceiling to every
Room in your game. For outdoor rooms that have only sky and ground, use
the OutdoorRoom class defined below.
