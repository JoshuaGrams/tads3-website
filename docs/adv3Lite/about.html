      Periplus is the Latinization of the Greek word περίπλους (<i>periplous</i>,
      contracted from περίπλοος <i>periploos</i>),
      which is <q>a sailing-around</q>.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <b><a href="https://www.tads.org" target="_blank">TADS 3</a></b> is a free authoring system for writing
    your own interactive fiction (IF).
    <b><a href="https://users.ox.ac.uk/~manc0049/TADSGuide/adv3Lite.htm" target="_blank">adv3Lite</a></b>
    is an alternate class library for TADS 3 whose goal is to simplify certain aspects of the standard
    adv3 library and introduce features found in other IF systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    This periplus organizes the adv3Lite library by topics and subject matter.
    Its goal is to make it easier to locate information on particular subjects when crafting
    a TADS 3 game.  Much of the information is also useful to writers using the adv3 system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>This is neither a complete adv3Lite class reference nor a TADS 3 programmer's guide.</b>
    The links under "See Also" will transport you to complete language and library documentation.
  </p>

  <h2>Organizing principles</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Reorganize existing documentation:</b>  None of the information presented here is
        new (or written by me).  Rather, this periplus reorganizes existing material in a novel
        way.

      <li><b>Designed for writers touched by the muse:</b>  Quite often when writing
        TADS 3 games, inspiration strikes&mdash;and then halts and cools while searching the
        documentation for the right class or property.  This resource is to
        help you find what you already know, and to help you discover what you may not.

      <li><b>Strive for clarity, not completeness:</b>  Even a casual comparison between this
        reference's class list and the complete class library will reveal the periplus'
        incompleteness.
        This is by design: Rather than link to <i>every</i> class in the library (many of which
        are internal the library itself), the periplus selects classes most
        useful for writing games.

      <li><b>Taxonomy, not hierarchy:</b>  Keen observers will notice some classes are listed twice,
        and that the class hierarchy is not preserved in the index structure.  Again, this is by design:
        When a class falls into multiple categories, it's listed where appropriate (such as
        with <code>SenseRegion</code>, which relates to the Sensory and Location).  Object hierarchy
        and inheritance should be gleaned from the technical reference pages, not from the
        periplus' organization.
    </ul>
  </p>
